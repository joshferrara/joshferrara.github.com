The Live The Dream Women's Conference is underway as of last night, and it is rocking so far. You know, as Women's conferences are, ;)

I'm kidding, of course. I love it, I'm glad I get to be a part of helping out, and and serving the ladies of our church and across the country.

In other news, I added some (ok, a lot) of new banners to the list of rotating banners. Most are from Italy, and the ones that are my favorites have my beautiful Italian friends in them, so I hope you enjoy.

Oh, and yes, I do plan to talk more about the trip, and show some pictures soon.
