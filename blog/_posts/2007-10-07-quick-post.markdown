In the middle of a service, but right now there is no translator, so I'm ok ;)

First of all, Rob, as crazy as it is, there are french fries at almost every meal (they are frequent), and they are some of the best french fries I've ever tasted. Wild, I know.

Working on being able to post on the Italy Team Blog, sorry about that delay. But I'll be on mine, so that'll have to do for now. Apparently, Sicily is not a place that has readily accepted the world wide web.

Well earlier this afternoon we packed up our stuff, and hopped on the bus to head 2 hours across Sicily to the town of Catania, to our next place we will be working. That is the church I'm in right now. I gotta tell ya, it was not easy saying goodbye to all of the friends that we made. The fact that we grew so close while learning a new language is just God.

Please continue to pray for effectiveness and wisdom, the situations we are thrown into are always very interesting ;)

Pictures coming soon I hope...

Ciao a presto!
(Goodbye, till next time!)
