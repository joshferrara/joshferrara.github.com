Just a quick prayer request guys... If you were at <a href="http://www.healingplacechurch.org">HPC</a> this weekend you have heard this already...

There is a little boy named Sam Seidel who was rushed to the hospital last night. His parents found him at the bottom of their pool. He is alive but in critical condition. He is 2 years old. Most of you know Aimee Gwaltney (Aimee Cait), anyway, she was his nanny for a long time and we both got really close to him.

Please keep him and his family in your prayers as they are going through this rough time. We know that no matter what satan tries to steal from this family he must repay one hundred times over! He is in God's hands and there is no attack of the devil that can stand against that!

&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt;

If you would like updates on same check out CaringBridge.com, click "View CaringBridge Site", and enter the name "samseidel". This will take you to a site that his parents post updates on very regularly. Please stay in prayer!
