Added some new pictures to the Photo section from the Italy trip, you should check them out! And tomorrow with any luck I'll add some of my recent phone pictures.

Sooo, check out the photo section!

And here's just a little teaser... I snuck this photo inside the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catacombs_of_Rome">Roman catacombs</a>, when we weren't supposed to be taking pictures(notice the shoot-from-the-hip angle), so don't tell the monk security guards...
