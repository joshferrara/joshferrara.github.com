        <p>Sooo, I started my day pretty early. And I was walking through the quad and I saw this...</p>

<p><img src="http://apollo.divshare.com/thumbs/2007/04/27/495299/495299-5b3_mid.jpg" border="0" /></p>

<p>For a split second I was totally impressed with <a href="http://toriohlerking.blogspot.com">Tori</a>'s self-marketing. I know, I'm an idiot, but I forgot it was a national thing :]</p>

<p>Anyway, after class I went to the library...</p>

<p><img src="http://apollo.divshare.com/thumbs/2007/04/27/495474/495474-89b_mid.jpg" border="0" /></p>

<p>While I was in the library I checked on some grades and one of my biggest projects was posted and I got a 100 on it! So I decided to celebrate. So I headed to Mr. Ghatti's with Caleb Persick and Caleb Crawford (from the band NoShoes)...</p>

<p><img src="http://apollo.divshare.com/thumbs/2007/04/27/495298/495298-e14_mid.jpg" border="0" /></p>

<p>After lunch, I finished my last class and started on my way home, but not before stopping at Benny's to get a car wash... I really enjoy Benny's, don't tell anyone...</p>

<p><img src="http://apollo.divshare.com/thumbs/2007/04/27/495297/495297-c43_mid.jpg" border="0" /></p>

<p>Then I finally started on my way home. But of course, I needed gas...</p>

<p><img src="http://apollo.divshare.com/thumbs/2007/04/27/495351/495351-c6e_mid.jpg" border="0" /></p>

<p>It was way too expensive.</p>

<p>The end.</p>

<p>Wasn't that exciting? Almost like you were with me all day, right?</p>

<p>Ok, I just had some pictures I wanted to show off.  And here are the rest :]</p>

<p>These are some of the coolest people around.  Ch-ch-ch-check it out:</p>

        <p>Alright, first I want to apologize that I do alot of shouting-out lately. I understand that it can be taken as a lame excuse for blogging, but I assure you, I'm not trying to pass it off as such. I'm amazed daily at the amazing people that I am blessed to work with and know on a daily basis. That being said... Sweat me.</p>

<p>First off, go check out my boy Ryan Miller aka <a href="http://www.ryanmiller.wordpress.com">MILLERACHI</a>! I haven't known him for long but I know he's got some good stuff to say, so check him out, he's a new blogger! Give him some love.</p>

<p>Ok, this one is half-way a shout-out, but really I need to brag on someone.</p>

<p>Most of my readers know or know off Jason Laird aka <a href="http://jasonlaird.com">Tweezy</a>. For those of you that don't know, he is the high-school pastor at <a href="http://www.healingplacechurch.org">HPC</a>. He's slightly throw'd off for Jesus, if you know what I mean. (it's a good thing, don't hide your kids)</p>

<p>Like I said, I'm blessed to be able to call him a friend and leader in my life. But he did something last night that really impressed me. It wasn't some huge sermon (although if you were at <a href="http://refuge.healingplacechurch.org">Refuge</a> then you heard his slamming message which was, not ironically, what I'm about to talk about) But no, this wasn't anything super spiritual. We were sitting in McDonalds after a meeting last night (yeah, we roll to MD's for meetings at HPC) and the good Doctor Tweeze was heading to the door on his way home. I mentioned to someone that he had on a pretty rockin belt and buckle. Anyway, he heard his name but not the comment. As soon as I told him that I was just complimenting his belt, without thinking he pulled it off, handed it to me with a quick "love you man" and headed on his way home.</p>

<p>If you have ever doubted his sincerity, I implore you to rethink that opinion. I know that it's not a huge deal, but it speaks volumes about his heart, and more importantly the DNA of the church! This freak will give you the clothes of his back (or waist) if he thinks it will even slightly make a difference in your life! That is what it is all about! Are you willing to do whatever it takes?</p>

<p>We have the solution that the world is in desperate need of. We have this solution in our Savior. Do you value it as such in your life? I know I go many days where I certainly don't. Revolution will not take place until the revolutionaries believe that they have something worth changing the world for! Are you willing to do what it takes? Are you willing to sacrifice everything and <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:2-8;&amp;version=50;">count it all joy</a>? Do you believe in the value that you hold? Do you believe it enough to give it away?</p>

        <p>What do you do on the days when everything seems to be going wrong? How do you respond when the things you thought to be so distant from the realm of possibilities have suddenly snuck up on you?</p>

        <p>Alright, it seems everyone is doing this these days, but I certainly don't want to recieve to much flack about this ( so shut it, seriously). A decent amount of my blog viewers are non-HPCers. This is for you.</p>

<p><strong>This is a compound shout-out.</strong></p>

<p>First of all, I have to give some love to <a href="http://kayceesmith.blogspot.com">Kaycee Smith</a>. For those of you that don't know, she is one of the interns at <a href="http://www.healingplacechurch.org">HPC</a> in the <a href="http://healingplacechurch.org/elevate.php">Elevate</a> program. However, that's not why she is recieving attention right now. Since she created her blog, she has had around 120 visitors to her site. in the 3 days since I've been added to her blogroll, I have consistently had 12 visitors a day that were refered to my site from Kaycee's blog! You do the math. Anyway, I enjoy her blog, so you should check it out!</p>

<p>This next blogger really caught me off guard. It has quickly earned a place in my top 10 most viewed blogs. He's got an awesome writing style and you definitely need to check it out! Ladies and Gentleman, let me introduce to you... <a href="http://www.areowebee.com">Rob Gros</a>.</p>

<p>Now this blogger has become one of my best friends in the last year. I love his heart and passion for worship and God. Last night I was able to catch a glimps of him and a friend leading worship at a local youth group and I was blown away. If you are looking for a young guy with some awesome insight on life, please check out <a href="http://refugejturn.blogspot.com/">Jamie Phillips</a>.</p>

<p>And now, a story.</p>

<p>I am a student in the field of <a href="http://www.manship.lsu.edu">Mass Communication</a> and media at <a href="http://www.lsu.edu">LSU</a>. One of the things that we are constantly having reinforced into us is the fact that we are, in a sense, gate-keepers of information. Whether it is an editor of a newspaper, a producer of a movie, or a book publisher, there is a gate-keeper who decided whether or not to let that information past them. Very few things will ever be heard about on a wide-scale level if there is no media used to push it. This position as gate-keepers is one that is often not as high of a priority in the media realm as it should be.</p>

<p>One of the growing concerns amoung media ethics experts is the issue of bloggers. There is no gate-keeper. No accountability to a large extent. Someone can slander another's name, and there are no restrictions or consequences.</p>

<p>However, this is not the case in my life. I would like to thank <a href="http://michaelgriffis.com">Michael Griffis</a> and <a href="http://jpbrumfield.com">JP Brumfield</a>, you guys are my gate-keepers. Not so much in a controling way, but I know you hold a high standard in blogs, and it makes me keep the content up.</p>

<p>I salute you. <a href="http://michaelgriffis.com">Griffis</a>, blogger for the people. <a href="http://jpbrumfield.com">JP</a>, blog prince of blogorhea.</p>
