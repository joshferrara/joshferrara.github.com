        <p>If you weren't there (shame shame), this weekend was absolutely amazing at <a href="http://www.healingplacechurch.org">HPC</a>! With 7 services at our Highland Road Campus alone, and around 15 more at our other campuses around the globe, the story of His sacrifice was definitely celebrated and shared in an awesome way.</p>

<small><small>10 a.m. service at HPC Easter 2007, photo credit: <a href="http://danohlerking.blogspot.com">Dan</a>, I think...</small></small></p>

<p>I was blessed to be able to take part in the services at our main campus this year. If you have ever had thoughts of doubt towards the multi-campus, large church approach, I really urge you to come visit for a weekend. I was absolutely blown away again by the atmosphere that our staff and volunteer teem provided for anyone seeking an encounter with God this weekend. But of course, none of that amounts to much if God doesn't show up. And show up He did.</p>

<p>The altar was flooded during every single service with people who made decisions for Jesus for the first time. There is nothing quite like someone making that decision on Easter Sunday morning...</p>

<p>Pastor <a href="http://dinorizzo.com">Dino</a> delevered a strong and clear message that definitely made me think during each service. Praise God for a church that is blessed with a pastor that hears from God!</p>

<p>This weekend was a huge success for the kingdom!</p>

<p>Props to the band guys and gals, you are awesome! <a href="http://jasonryder.blogspot.com">J-Dawg</a>, your song was rocking bro. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/joecausey">Joe</a>, I'm gonna miss you man! We'll be up there to visit you soon enough I'm sure.</p>

<p>Also, much respect to my boy Doug Musso for showing up even the pastor!

        <p>We had a little get together today for Joe Causey at Brunet's. Joe will be leaving
us this week to go do freelance work in Nashville and work with some pretty neat
people.</p>

<p>If you have met Joe you know that he will be missed greatly at HPC.

He's a great guy. Even though he's going to be working with rockstars he still made
time to come have lunch with the little people. He even brought along his Barbie
laptop to show us.</p>

        <p>Ok, you might have noticed a changing in my blogging environment. Nothing has really changed for you, just the new stuff to look at. It's going to be getting very cool around here soon, and I'm working on figuring out the moble blogging on my new server.</p>

<p>Also, thanks to <a href="http://www.jpbrumfield.com">JP</a> and <a href="http://www.fazha.com">Fazha</a> for the help in getting this set up.</p>

<p>Ok, so we were eating at Champps tonight with Ben, <a href="http://jpbrumfield.com">JP</a>, Leah, Sarah... annnd I'm so sorry but I forgot everyone else's names! Anyway, we got into a discussion, and we need your opinion...</p>

<p>Here is the situation... we are eating our meal, people are even being seated around us, and suddenly we look over and there is a staffmember starting to vacuum the room. Now, <a href="http://jpbrumfield.com">JP</a> and myself were under that impression that its pretty sleazy to do that while guests are there. It detracts from the experience. J. Menck on the other hand thinks that it's cool cause they're just trying to finish for the night.</p>

<p>What is your opinion? How do you feel? Make your voice heard!</p>

<p>All I can tell you is that when <a href="http://jpbrumfield.com">J.P.</a> &amp; J.B.'s Grill opens its doors, the guests' dining experience will not be hindered by someone trying to get off 30 minutes early by cleaning while people are eating.</p>

<p>Tonight we made an expedition to the world of New Orleans. Andrew Price, Andrew Scott and myself went on a mission to pick up Andrew Ficara so he could be at Eddie G.&#39;s wedding. Andrew Ficara is living in L.A. right now, working for Universal Studios but we wanted to get him in for the wedding so here he is :)</p>
