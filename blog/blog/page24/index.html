<p>He is my favorite Italian ever. He was our interpreter this week, and I don't think I've ever met a person with a more genuine love of God and People. Praise God for worldwide family!</p>

<p>This picture doesn't do it justice, but this is where we are about to play a worship concert! God is amazing!</p>

        <p>In the middle of a service, but right now there is no translator, so I'm ok ;)</p>

<p>First of all, Rob, as crazy as it is, there are french fries at almost every meal (they are frequent), and they are some of the best french fries I've ever tasted. Wild, I know.</p>

<p>Working on being able to post on the Italy Team Blog, sorry about that delay. But I'll be on mine, so that'll have to do for now. Apparently, Sicily is not a place that has readily accepted the world wide web.</p>

<p>Well earlier this afternoon we packed up our stuff, and hopped on the bus to head 2 hours across Sicily to the town of Catania, to our next place we will be working. That is the church I'm in right now. I gotta tell ya, it was not easy saying goodbye to all of the friends that we made. The fact that we grew so close while learning a new language is just God.</p>

<p>Please continue to pray for effectiveness and wisdom, the situations we are thrown into are always very interesting ;)</p>

<p>Pictures coming soon I hope...</p>

<p>Ciao a presto!
(Goodbye, till next time!)</p>

        <p>I should probably wait until I have more time to ponder this and make it more poetic and such, but I've just got to share it.
It seems like every new opportunity to travel and meet new people brings a new method for God to display not only his love for us, but His willingness to saturate our lives with it if we will walk in it. Follow me here...
We could have had many reactions to arriving in Sicily, from frustration to apathy, it was all possible and very understandable. But we chose to simply walk in the only love we knew... "ciao", and a smile. Since my first double-kiss in the homeland, God has continued to pour favor and compassion, into us and the people we are meeting.
You would be absolutely amazed if you had just sat in the conversation Tabitha, Mark Bordelon, and myself just sat in at lunch. To start with zero knowledge and be able to communicate with almost anyone in the building is incredible! We talk about everything from music to school. Mark and I even taught them how to "TIGER BAIT!"
All this to say that God will let you do the seemingly impossible if you will simply choose to walk in His love and share it with everyone around you.
Thank you again for your prayers, they are much appreciated!</p>
