<p>This is Scott Steelman and translator laying down the word right now during our 1st session, and God is really flowing through him.
Interesting fact... it is 11pm right now, and service just started, because we just finished eating! I love these people!
The language barrier is a very weak one here, we're able to converse decently, and even practice our italian, and I've already had a few offers to move to Sicily and live with my new family :)
God is really doing something incredible over here, I wish I could take each of you here to experience the hunger and passion for God's word that is flowing from these hearts.
I haven't found high-speed internet yet, so  the high quality pics are still on their way. But don't worry, they are coming and trust me, they don't do this place justice.
Thank you all for your prayers and comments! Keep them coming! We can read them, but it is a little more difficult for us to reply just yet.
Keep praying, your support and prayers are growing to fruition right in front of us!
More to come!</p>
