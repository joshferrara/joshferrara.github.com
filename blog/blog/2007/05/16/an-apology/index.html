<p>I would like to take this time to apologize to my readers for the past week of inactivity in blogging, but more importantly, for the preceding week of <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=blogorrhea">blogorrhea</a>.</p>

<p>You see, during that time period, blogging was my way of remaining sane amidst the swirling and crazy world of studying for finals at <a href="http://www.lsu.edu">LSU</a>.</p>

<p>Alas, this is no excuse.</p>

<p>The same goes for this current week and the lack of posts that have encompassed it. There are no excuses, simply my own lack of energy, again, as a result of the terrible mess that we call finals.</p>

<p>But that is all over now. Today, we turn over a new leaf. This will most definitely be a blogging Summer, and I will strive to keep the highest quality in my posting, for you, the readers.</p>

<p>Also, I will be introducing a few new categories to my blog. Some will be fun and recreational, others will be regular pieces aimed at a general goal. More explanations will follow.</p>

<p>I would like to leave you with this picture. I found this guy at Tabitha's house. For those of you that don't know, Tabitha is one of the few at <a href="http://www.healingplacechurch.org">HPC</a> that share my wonderful Italian heritage.</p>

<p>I hope this brightens your day.</p>
