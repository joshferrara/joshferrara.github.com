<p>Ahh, you simply must experience the joy and relief of finishing a Spring semester to fully understand this amazing feeling. The grades weren't as hot as I'd like, but I'll live with a few B's.</p>

<p>I learned a lot this semester about study habits and college in general. It's crazy, but I'll be very ready to hit it again full force in the Fall!</p>

<p>But, before that!... This summer is going to be awesome! Heading to Los Angeles with the <a href="http://refuge.healingplacechurch.org/">Refuge</a> mission trip team, hitting up <a href="http://store.healingplacechurch.org/ministries/latenite/07/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/fusionweb.jpg">Fusion</a>, the first ever <a href="http://store.healingplacechurch.org/ministries/latenite/07/">LateNite</a> Retreat, annnd of course, <a href="http://submerge.healingplacechurch.org/">Submerge</a> Summer Camp, for the j-high and highschool sessions! And then even next semester a few weeks into school I'll be heading to Italy for an amazing opportunity to do some missions work with the <a href="http://store.healingplacechurch.org/ministries/latenite/07/">LateNite</a> team.</p>

<p>It's going to be an awesome summer, and an awesome remainder of this year!</p>

<p>Good luck to everyone on your remaining finals, and I hope everyone did awesome!</p>
