<p>Here is our greatest find yet! Take special note of <a href="http://jasonryder.blogspot.com">J-dog</a> and his mad skills. It may not hold a charge for too long but its amazing and will be making a debut at Submerge summer camp this summer.</p>

<p>Also, please remember to keep <a href="http://aimeecait.blogspot.com/">Aimee</a> in your prayers this week. She's in England visiting the place she will be living next year. I'm so proud of her, but I miss her already.</p>

<p>Ok, back to work....</p>
