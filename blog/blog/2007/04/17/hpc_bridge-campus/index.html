<p>Ok, you really need to read this <strong>awesome</strong> post by our highschool pastor, Jason Laird aka <a href="http://jasonlaird.blogspot.com">Tweez</a>. If you read further down in his blog you will see more info about what we half-jokingly refer to now as the HPC_Bridge Campus.</p>

<p>I love this. This is why I feel at home at Healing Place Church. This is why I think This is one of the most amazing groups of people on the planet, not because of anything they have done other than allow themselves to be used to show His love at the most basic levels.</p>

<p>Seeing a need and meeting it. That is what Jesus did. He didn't spend His time building a following, He wasn't worry about finding the nicest sandals. He served. That is what church is about, that is what being a christian is about. I love it!</p>

<p>Here's a clipping from the post...</p>

<blockquote><strong>"5 days ago there supposedly was 7500 homeless people in B.R. well, as of today there must be 7497.....may not seem like a big difference but ask marc, chief, and alex....its a big difference to them..."</strong></blockquote>


<p><strong>That</strong> is what it is <strong>all</strong> about. Changing the world by serving one.</p>

<p>Way to go Tweez, thanks for allowing yourself to be God's hands and feet and touching lives at the most basic level. You inspire me ;]</p>
