<p>So this is me trying to make myself feel better about the massive amounts of time that I spend working with school stuff.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://josh-bob.com/mc2015/index.html" target="_blank">this site</a>. It's something I had to put together for one of my classes.</p>

<p>Please don't hate. I actually only spent about 30 minutes on the design of the site. It's mainly to host the other projects we completed in the class this year.</p>

<p>Anyway, take a look see and tell me if you want to be an Advertising student like me!</p>

<p>Two (2) more weeks people, and we are finished for the summer. I don't know about you, but that can't come soon enough.</p>

<p>That's all for now. Show some love.</p>
