<p>Quick shoutout to my boy <a href="http://pleblanc.net">Phill</a>. He's one of the coolest cats around HPC and I get to call him a friend of mine.</p>

<p>Anyway, he used his camera phone skills last night to snap a picture, and I thought it was pretty tight.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.pleblanc.net">his blog</a> and go shake his hand next time you see him!</p>
