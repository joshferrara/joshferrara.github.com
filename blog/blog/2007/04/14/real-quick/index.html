<p>Nothing much to say tonight, crazy weekend already, plenty more to go!</p>

<p>BUT, you need to go right now and read <a href="http://gmohnay.blogspot.com/2007/04/vision-cheeseburger.html">this post</a> by <a href="http://gmohnay.blogspot.com/">Gabi LeBlanc</a> from earlier today. It is so true, and it really makes you evaluate how you view your faith. I know it did for me. Good stuff Gabi.</p>

<p>Anyway, go check it out!</p>

<p>I'll see you at <a href="http://www.healingplacechurch.org">HPC</a> this weekend ;]</p>
