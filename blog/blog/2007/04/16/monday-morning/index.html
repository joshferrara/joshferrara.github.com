<p>It's usually not a welcome thing (unless you are like one of my many HPC compadres who have today OFF), But waking up on a Monday morning and finding that you are struggling with a cold or something of that nature... it's just not good.</p>

<p>Soooo, we take lots of AirBorne and start of the day. Right? Right.</p>

<p>Also, I'm so curious what someone's explanation of global warming would sound like on a cold day in April...</p>

<p>Also again, check out <a href="http://aimeecait.blogspot.com/2007/04/and-im-christian.html">this post</a> by my best friend <a href="http://aimeecait.blogspot.com">Aimee Gwaltney</a>! She is so much better at expressing her thoughts on any subject in words. I'm totally jealous.</p>
