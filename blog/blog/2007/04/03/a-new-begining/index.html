<p>Ok, you might have noticed a changing in my blogging environment. Nothing has really changed for you, just the new stuff to look at. It's going to be getting very cool around here soon, and I'm working on figuring out the moble blogging on my new server.</p>

<p>Also, thanks to <a href="http://www.jpbrumfield.com">JP</a> and <a href="http://www.fazha.com">Fazha</a> for the help in getting this set up.</p>
