<p>Ok, normally I wouldn't make a post about this, but it's just so darn cool that it happened like this, you just have to hear about it :)</p>

<p>So here is the story...</p>

<p>December 1st, 2006... A young LSU freshman decides that he is going to document life, share his thoughts, and give himself a reason to sit down and write about life. This young man was none other than yours truly, and you might have guessed, the fruits of that decision became what you now know as <strong>Josh-Bob.com. </strong>You can see that first post <a href="http://josh-bob.com/2006/12/01/a-baby-blog/">here</a>. December 1st is tomorrow. In other words, today is the 365th day of my blogging life.</p>

<p>This is where it gets cool... Today, as you see in the picture below, as of this morning I have broken the 20,000 hits mark on my blog. The only thing greater than my joy to still be here after a year, is my joy that I haven't faded into irrelevancy over this time.</p>
