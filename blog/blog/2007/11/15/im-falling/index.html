<p>Ok, for once, I know what kind of vehicle I really want. And here it is.</p>

<p>Crazy, right? I've never considered myself a truck guy, but then again, I'm not really sure what car category you'd put me in. Not your normal convertible fan, not really a minivan pilot either though.</p>

<p>Anyway, this has caught my eye, so we'll see what happens. My recent business venture with <a href="http://grissmithers.blogspot.com/">Greg</a> seems to be taking off, so that's always good. Who knew so many businesses needed new websites? Yay God for handling financial situations :)</p>

<p>However, in the words of <a href="http://jpbrumfield.com">JP</a>, any anonymous financial donations are quite welcome.</p>
