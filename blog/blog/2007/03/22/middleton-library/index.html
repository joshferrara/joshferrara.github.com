<p>If you flinched when you read this title, we can be friends.</p>

<p>I've had a few people ask why I don't post many pictures from school, and well, I honestly don't know why they asked. First of all, the majority of my pictures are, in fact, on campus. Secondly, I do not find joy in school. Accomplishment, maybe. Getting closer each day to graduating, yes. But there is no joy in everyday school, as you can see in this picture.</p>

<p>Also, Griffis... I had a dream last night and you and I were running from a crazed taco moster, and he was screaming "That's alot of taco!" Weird, right?</p>

<p>Anyway. Switchfoot and Copeland tonight. Many pictures and much video will follow.</p>
