<p>Ok, so blogging isn't about competition, right? Right.</p>

<p>But... If it was, this would be some of the competition.</p>

<p>Ok, in all honesty these are my boys. Check out their blogs (<a href="http://jasonryder.blogspot.com">J-Dawg</a> &amp; <a href="http://jpbrumfield.com">JP</a>) if you in the mood for some good reading.</p>

<p>As long as we're being honest, I really just wanted to post some pics from practice tonight. If you've ever seen the awesome God-given talent of the HPC worship team, this is the stuff behind what you hear on Sunday mornings with a whole lot of anointing mixed in with it ;)</p>
