<p>Ok, so everyone knows about the whole "The Way I See It" campaign at <a href="http://www.starbucks.com">Starbucks</a>, right? Cool. So, last night I was over there studying. Anyway, I usually take a look to see what insight my cup of coffee has to offer me, and it's usually much too poetic to do any real good. Tonight was a little different though, sooo I thought I'd share the wisdom, since after all, it was shared with me first. Here is the slamming quote from Jodi Picoult...</p>

<blockquote style="font-style: italic;">"What would you do for someone you love? Would you lie, cheat, steal? Break the law and call it justice? Would you say yes? Scream no? Would you kill? Would you give up your own life? Would you move mountains, swallow fire, keep a promise? Would you change the world? <span style="font-weight: bold;">Would you change yourself?</span>"</blockquote>

<p>I guess it reminded me of a message <a href="http://www.myspace.com/jasonlaird">Jason Laird</a> preached recently at Refuge. His main point was that so many times people are willing to die for what they believe in, but what God is asking is for us to <span style="font-style: italic;">live</span> for him. And usually, this is the harder road to walk.</p>

<p>Ok, that's all for now. I have tests all this week and next, including an Accounting test that I possibly failed. Pray!</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>
