<p>So, here it is. My first mobilepost from my new phone. The picture is pretty much what it seems. My astronomy class went to the 5th floor/roof of the astronomy building to check out some telescopes and other astronomical stuff. Anyway, we get up there and we seem to have busted this older gentlemen on the roof of the next building while he was taking his smoke break. Best part of course, being the fact that he was smoking a pipe.</p>
