<p>Ok, I don't know why I haven't done this yet, but I just thought I would let my beautiful blogging family know that I am on the search for a vehichle.</p>

<p>I don't want a brand new one, but I also don't really want a '93 Ford Focus ;)</p>

<p>Decent gas milage would be nice, and I need a little luggage room for my guitar gear and friend's.
Also, if it's a BMW, thats a plus. :)</p>

<p>If you or anyone you know is selling, or even if you just see a good deal, please let me know! That would be amazing.
Thanks guys, ya'll are the best!</p>
