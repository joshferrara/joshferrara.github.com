<p>God is really moving in some unbelievable ways here... Tyler Cheramie and myself were able to pray with about 5 guys within a 30 minute period. We've seen people breakdown, beg for prayer, accept Christ, and we've also had cursing and hatred thrown around. And yet, I've never felt more compassion than I do now. The exciting thing about it is that even though the growth has come during this trip, it's not something that is temporary. I pray that God only continues to grow inside of me an understanding of the value of one of his kids. I want my heart to break for what breaks my Father's heart. I want to go beyond charity, this is not an option. This is justice. It is what we are called to do.</p>

<p>I'm definitely posting again tonight. We have a late night outreach later, and we're expecting some awesome stuff. Pray!</p>

<p>I love it. The spanish community in L.A. is so thankful and loving of Christ's love. I'm quickly remembering my spanish class years, but they are extremely patient as we try to communicate. I love it!</p>

        <p>Well it's taken forever to find stable internet, and just when we found some, the server went down. I'm sure there is some place where we'll find internet later, but until then, the only posting I'll be doing is from my phone. So please, pardon the errors.</p>

<p>Well to start off, yesterday we split up into 2 groups to work with the Dreamcenter staff. The group I was with went down to what they call "Skid Row". It's basically the downtown area where a large portion of the homeless population spends their time. HPC has been doing homeless outreaches for a little while now but even the guys who have done it for a while realized that it is a very different kind of homelessness. An entirely different level really. We've seen things that you don't expect in 3rd world countries, and yet they happen everyday just a few blocks away from the Sunset strip. I'll have to write alot more about this when I find a real keyboard.</p>

<p>The second group went to a part of the community that has a spanish majority. With only a few people in the group actually speaking spanish, this proved to stretch them quite a bit, but they will all tell you that they were really touched by these people's hearts and willingness to try to understand simply because we were reaching out to them. On their way back to the vehichles they passed by a building with a sign that read "Church of Satan". I don't know about you, but that shocked me. You hear about things like this, but you certainly wouldn't find something like that in downtown Baton Rouge.</p>

<p>It has already been an amazing trip so far,  and we still have alot to go. Please keep praying that God would soften the hearts of people we come in contact with, and that we would be fully aware of the amazing things God is doing all around us.</p>
