        <p>Quick shoutout to my boy <a href="http://pleblanc.net">Phill</a>. He's one of the coolest cats around HPC and I get to call him a friend of mine.</p>

<p>Anyway, he used his camera phone skills last night to snap a picture, and I thought it was pretty tight.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.pleblanc.net">his blog</a> and go shake his hand next time you see him!</p>

        <p>I had seen them before and I wasn't expecting a normal concert, but <a href="http://www.delirious.co.uk/">Delirious</a> definitely impressed me all over again last night.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.divshare.com/download/377712-1b2"><img src="http://apollo.divshare.com/apollo2/thumbs/2007/04/11/377712/377712-1b2_mid.jpg" border="0"></a></p>

<p>They are the real deal. Totally ministry-minded. I love it. If you have never read anything about them and their ministry, you probably should check out their <a href="http://www.delirious.co.uk/">website</a> and read around.</p>

<p>Basically, they started out putting on an event for the teens in their community in the early '90s called "Delirious?", much like our "<a href="http://josh-bob.com/?p=16">RED</a>". Soon it became a regular event. After a while someone proposed the idea of recording the worship portion of the event. To make an extremely long story short, they titled the album "Delirious?" after the event. The CD started traveling faster than they had expected and crossing all sorts of boundaries. The cool thing was that in Europe, there isn't so much of a seperation in the music industry between secular and Christian charts. Anyway, people who were not familiar with the event that they were hosting thought that the CD was a recording of a band named Delirious? What started out as a misunderstanding became a phenomenon.</p>

<p>How crazy is that? Our God can use ANYTHING for his will to be done! They had no intentions of starting a band or traveling the world, and they were blindsided by His plan! I love it.</p>

<p>Really awesome story. One of the things that I think is the coolest is that now they travel with 50+ people on 4 tour busses anytime they go anywhere, including their entire families (16 kids!) and a road pastor from their home church. Don't tell me God doesn''t take care of His kids.</p>

<p>I really need to start taking a digital camera everywhere if I'm going to pursue this blogging lifestyle ;]</p>

<p>Here are a few of my favorite pics from my phone. Click "More" to see more pics. Simple, right?</p>

        <p>Ok, I just realized that I haven't done this yet, and since I'm just sitting in class, I figured it would be the perfect time.  ;)</p>

<p>If you are looking for something to read that will make you think, head over to <a href="http://jasonlaird.blogspot.com">Jason Laird's blog</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://jasonlaird.blogspot.com">Tweezy</a> is someone that God worked through in a crazy way in my life, and one of the biggest reasons I am involved like I am at <a href="http://www.healingplacechurch.org">HPC</a>. On top of all that, he's so darn cute, and you'll never hear a pastor bust a rhyme quite like him...</p>

<p>So, head on over to his blog and show the brother some love!</p>

<p>In other news, <a href="http://www.lsu.edu">school</a> is back in my life again... I know, it was only spring break, but it was quite relaxing! So, what did you do on your spring break? Or is yours this week instead? Let me know how your Easter was too!</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

        <p>Last post before I head to bed...</p>

<p>This weekend the worship team played a song special that really spoke to me. If you know me pretty closely, you know I'm a sucker for basic truth in writing and I pretty much try to keep to that theme with the stuff that I write.</p>

<p>Anyway, this song is incredible. It was of course a hymn first and was later rearanged by Kristian Stanfill, I believe. If you don't think about anything else this Easter just check out these lyrics and take a listen. This isn't HPC Music, but I might have that soon...</p>

<p>Ok, really this time... Happy Easter, and goodnight.</p>

<blockquote><em>I hear the Savior say, â€œThy strength indeed is small;
Child of weakness, watch and pray, Find in Me thine all in all.â€

Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.

Lord, now indeed I find Thy power and Thine alone,
Can change the leperâ€™s spots And melt the heart of stone.

Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.

And when before the throne I stand in Him complete,
"Jesus died my soul to save" my lips shall still repeat

Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.

<strong>Oh Praise the one who paid my debt
And raised this life up from the dead!
Oh Praise the one who paid my debt
And raised this life up from the dead!</em>
</strong>
