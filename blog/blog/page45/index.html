<p>Ok, so blogging isn't about competition, right? Right.</p>

<p>But... If it was, this would be some of the competition.</p>

<p>Ok, in all honesty these are my boys. Check out their blogs (<a href="http://jasonryder.blogspot.com">J-Dawg</a> &amp; <a href="http://jpbrumfield.com">JP</a>) if you in the mood for some good reading.</p>

<p>As long as we're being honest, I really just wanted to post some pics from practice tonight. If you've ever seen the awesome God-given talent of the HPC worship team, this is the stuff behind what you hear on Sunday mornings with a whole lot of anointing mixed in with it ;)</p>

<p>Here is a pic of pastor Kasevich delivering a slaming word at Refuge, our highschool ministry tonight.</p>

<p>Good stuff!</p>

<p>Also, please keep Sam Seidel and his family in your prayers. He is doing much better, but God is not done!</p>

        <p>Just a quick prayer request guys... If you were at <a href="http://www.healingplacechurch.org">HPC</a> this weekend you have heard this already...</p>

<p>There is a little boy named Sam Seidel who was rushed to the hospital last night. His parents found him at the bottom of their pool. He is alive but in critical condition. He is 2 years old. Most of you know Aimee Gwaltney (Aimee Cait), anyway, she was his nanny for a long time and we both got really close to him.</p>

<p>Please keep him and his family in your prayers as they are going through this rough time. We know that no matter what satan tries to steal from this family he must repay one hundred times over! He is in God's hands and there is no attack of the devil that can stand against that!</p>

<p>&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt;</p>

<p>If you would like updates on same check out CaringBridge.com, click "View CaringBridge Site", and enter the name "samseidel". This will take you to a site that his parents post updates on very regularly. Please stay in prayer!</p>

<p>If you flinched when you read this title, we can be friends.</p>

<p>I've had a few people ask why I don't post many pictures from school, and well, I honestly don't know why they asked. First of all, the majority of my pictures are, in fact, on campus. Secondly, I do not find joy in school. Accomplishment, maybe. Getting closer each day to graduating, yes. But there is no joy in everyday school, as you can see in this picture.</p>

<p>Also, Griffis... I had a dream last night and you and I were running from a crazed taco moster, and he was screaming "That's alot of taco!" Weird, right?</p>

<p>Anyway. Switchfoot and Copeland tonight. Many pictures and much video will follow.</p>
