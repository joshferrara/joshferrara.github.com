<p>Today would be the 24th birthday of a great friend of mine, <a href="http://www.jordanslegacy.com/" target="_blank">Jordan Gautreau</a>. If you didn't have the pleasure of knowing him, I assure you there haven't been many men like Jordan.</p>

<p>It's easy to talk about the ripple you'd hope to leave after you're gone. It is, perhaps, easier still to declare how you will carry on the memory of a passing loved one.</p>

<p>However, I firmly believe the hardest â€” and most impactful â€” thing you can do with your life is to leave a legacy that challenges others, whether they like it or not.</p>

<p>Well done, Jordan.</p>
