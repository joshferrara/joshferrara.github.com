<p>I don't know if I've ever sat down and penned a post about this yet, so I think its just about time.</p>

<p>My wonderful mother got involved in the blogger world (it sounds so dark when you say it that way) around a year or so ago (total chronological guess). Since then she's had really awesome opportunities, gotten the chance to write, and even speak a little, in some really awesome circles of women in the online community.</p>

<p>Anyway, she just posted this and I thought it was pretty cool. Check out this post about <a href="http://darnelle.wordpress.com/2008/09/13/counting-sparrows/">Hurricane Gustav and trusting God</a>, good stuff.</p>
