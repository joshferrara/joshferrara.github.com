<p>So its been a while since I updated the picture section (or the blog in general). Anyway, I just uploaded about 100 photos, all from the camera phone since around January. Not really in any particular order, just take them for what they're worth!</p>

<p>That being said, the main thing that has kept me from keeping up with the blog is my new fascination with <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>. I really don't know how else to explain it other than telling you to watch <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=ddO9idmax0o">this video</a>. Basically, it's life between (or instead of) blog posts.</p>

<p>So, if you're interested, check me out @ <a href="http://www.twitter.com/joshbob/">twitter.com/joshbob.</a></p>

<p>That's all for now. This summer is going to be good for the blog I think, got a little traveling planned and enough free time to change up a few things around here hopefully.</p>

<p>Blah blah blah, check out the <a href="http://www.josh-bob.com/photoalbum">photo section</a>.</p>
