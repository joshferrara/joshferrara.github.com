<p>Many of you know that we have been in prayer for <a href="http://www.joelstockstill.com">Joel Stockstill</a>'s wife, Amy, as she battles this terrible sickness. Wednesday night is the time for us to take the next step and join with our <a href="http://www.bethany.com">Bethany</a> family as they press in and declare her healing! HPC has cancelled all normal Wednesday night services and we are going to be joining Bethany at their South Campus in prayer.</p>

<p>Check out this post at <a href="http://www.mikehaman.com/?p=160">MikeHaman.com</a> for all the information. I hope to see you there, this is the body of Christ at it's strongest!</p>
