<p>You should know these faces by now. On the right is <a href="http://josh-bob.com/category/chris-in-class/">Chris</a> and <a href="http://josh-bob.com/2007/05/11/this-is-clay/">Clay</a> is on the left. What you see is them consuming some wonderful coffee as we study. What you don't see is the amazing coffee pot that brewed 12 cups in under 2 minutes. These are the days we will never forget.</p>

<p><em>Yes, the coffee pot was pretty astounding. That two minutes includes the prep work. Honestly, it almost seemed like the coffee was already made and it was just pouring it out. However, after investigating - and making 12 more cups of coffee - we realized that it was, in fact, just that amazing. </em></p>
