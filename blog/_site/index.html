        <p>Today would be the 24th birthday of a great friend of mine, <a href="http://www.jordanslegacy.com/" target="_blank">Jordan Gautreau</a>. If you didn't have the pleasure of knowing him, I assure you there haven't been many men like Jordan.</p>

<p>It's easy to talk about the ripple you'd hope to leave after you're gone. It is, perhaps, easier still to declare how you will carry on the memory of a passing loved one.</p>

<p>However, I firmly believe the hardest â€” and most impactful â€” thing you can do with your life is to leave a legacy that challenges others, whether they like it or not.</p>

<p>Well done, Jordan.</p>

        <p>"There is a time coming where we will be forced to choose between comfort and conviction. These will not be easy days, nor decisions made with ease; alas comfort sets the mind at ease, whilst conviction sets the soul â€” which will stand before the King â€” at ease."</p>

        <p>So, last year, around this time I decided that since I spend my days crafting WordPress beauty for others, I would begin spending my nights crafting the WP creation that is my own blog. For about a month I argued with myself over design, slowly choosing elements I liked, features I wanted, service I wanted to include, etc. So much easier to work when the client isn't yourself!</p>

<p>After a month I soft-launched the theme that you see now, with a few exceptions. At the beginning of 2010, the page included a link to a 'photo of the day' blog, as well as a Tumblr for what I thought would be a niche between WP and Twitter. Big Mistake! Too much content to was needed to keep the site looking alive! So after about a month, all 3 aspects of the blog were nearly lifeless. I'll admit, part of it is because I just resented Tumblr for not being like WordPress. What do you mean I have to edit themes ONLINE? I can't edit files in an editor? Needless to say, I have repented and turned back to what I've known all along with work, WordPress is the way.</p>

<p>So now, a new year is starting, and I'm making a new attempt to chronicle what happens in my life.To catch you up to speed, I thought I'd give you a one paragraph synopsis. I call it "2010: a josh odyssey". Here goes:</p>

<p>I started the year taking 2 winter session classes at <a href="http://lsu.edu">LSU</a> so I could graduate before turning 21. In the spring semester I took 21 hours, again, to speed up the graduation process. It was the hardest semester of my life. Long nights, group projects, real work, and balancing it all with running <a href="http://ferraracreative.com">my own company</a> to make a living and pay for school. Graduated in May within 2 weeks of turning 21. Finished with a 3.8 GPA (doesn't matter) and $0 of debt (matters a lot). A week later I took the <a href="http://twitter.com/gabrielleeee">girl of my dreams</a> to New Orleans and got down on one knee; she said "yes!" 2 weeks later I started working at <a href="http://gatorworks.net">Gatorworks</a> in addition to running <a href="http://ferraracreative.com">Ferrara Creative</a> (steady jobs impress chicks and their parents). In June we went to Cape Cod for 2 weeks on vacation. In October we went to New Orleans again, but this time we <a href="http://joshandgabi.com">got married</a>. After the wedding we decided to go to Europe for 2 weeks. That was fun. Then we came back home. Now we live in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Prairieville,+LA&amp;sll=30.330275,-91.009695&amp;sspn=0.017187,0.033023&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Prairieville,+Ascension,+Louisiana&amp;z=15">Prairieville</a> with a happy condo of our own, more kitchen appliances than we know what to do with, and a jolly fish named <a href="http://instagr.am/p/jhzy/">KatieBob</a>. The End.</p>

        <p>I've been really impacted the past few weeks by the incredible amount of generosity, but also the huge level of unity that I've seen in my life. I've seen people with lives, needs and situations of their own give of their time AND finances to help support a college student as he tries to make his way to Africa, and I've seen people raising money for mission trips of their own go out of their way to support others.</p>

<h2><strong>So here it is. </strong></h2>


<p>I challenge you to <strong>get involved</strong> in the incredible things going on around HPC and the globe. This isn't your time to travel? <strong>Give.</strong> Maybe you are saving for a trip yourself? <strong>Give.</strong> We all have 10 bucks to spare, it can go a long way. We are all in this together. We must support one another!</p>

<p>Here are 6 incredible opportunities for you to get involved in something larger than yourself. <strong>PRAY &amp; GIVE.</strong></p>

<h2>Go for it.</h2>


<p>These are people that, just like me and you, will not be able to <strong>go &amp; do</strong> without support. Your support. So hunt them down, email them, call them, Twitter them, <strong>just contact them</strong>, <em>pray</em> for them, and help <em>send</em> them as <strong>tools of love</strong>.</p>
