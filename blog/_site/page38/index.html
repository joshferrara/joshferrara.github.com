        <p>Alright, so I decided to write a post about the first ever, <a href="http://store.healingplacechurch.org/ministries/latenite/07/">Late Nite</a> Retreat called <a href="http://store.healingplacechurch.org/ministries/latenite/07/?page_id=114">Fusion</a>! and I decided that I should find a few good websites so I could link to them like any good blogger would.</p>

<p>As I began googling, I came across this site. Let me reassure you, this is not the retreat center we will be hanging out at, but the site is probably much funnier than the real one :] So check out this site. I think I will deem this one my "<a href="http://www.talltimbers.net/">worst website of the week</a>".</p>

<p>And finally, I just really just thought you should see this picture. <a href="http://joelle19938.blogspot.com/">Joelle</a> was just finishing putting together this wonderful purse when I decided to take it for a test drive. Turns out, it makes a much nicer hat. What would she do without me?</p>

        <p>I would like to take this time to apologize to my readers for the past week of inactivity in blogging, but more importantly, for the preceding week of <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=blogorrhea">blogorrhea</a>.</p>

<p>You see, during that time period, blogging was my way of remaining sane amidst the swirling and crazy world of studying for finals at <a href="http://www.lsu.edu">LSU</a>.</p>

<p>Alas, this is no excuse.</p>

<p>The same goes for this current week and the lack of posts that have encompassed it. There are no excuses, simply my own lack of energy, again, as a result of the terrible mess that we call finals.</p>

<p>But that is all over now. Today, we turn over a new leaf. This will most definitely be a blogging Summer, and I will strive to keep the highest quality in my posting, for you, the readers.</p>

<p>Also, I will be introducing a few new categories to my blog. Some will be fun and recreational, others will be regular pieces aimed at a general goal. More explanations will follow.</p>

<p>I would like to leave you with this picture. I found this guy at Tabitha's house. For those of you that don't know, Tabitha is one of the few at <a href="http://www.healingplacechurch.org">HPC</a> that share my wonderful Italian heritage.</p>

<p>I hope this brightens your day.</p>

        <p>Ahh, you simply must experience the joy and relief of finishing a Spring semester to fully understand this amazing feeling. The grades weren't as hot as I'd like, but I'll live with a few B's.</p>

<p>I learned a lot this semester about study habits and college in general. It's crazy, but I'll be very ready to hit it again full force in the Fall!</p>

<p>But, before that!... This summer is going to be awesome! Heading to Los Angeles with the <a href="http://refuge.healingplacechurch.org/">Refuge</a> mission trip team, hitting up <a href="http://store.healingplacechurch.org/ministries/latenite/07/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/fusionweb.jpg">Fusion</a>, the first ever <a href="http://store.healingplacechurch.org/ministries/latenite/07/">LateNite</a> Retreat, annnd of course, <a href="http://submerge.healingplacechurch.org/">Submerge</a> Summer Camp, for the j-high and highschool sessions! And then even next semester a few weeks into school I'll be heading to Italy for an amazing opportunity to do some missions work with the <a href="http://store.healingplacechurch.org/ministries/latenite/07/">LateNite</a> team.</p>

<p>It's going to be an awesome summer, and an awesome remainder of this year!</p>

<p>Good luck to everyone on your remaining finals, and I hope everyone did awesome!</p>
