        <p>Many of you know that we have been in prayer for <a href="http://www.joelstockstill.com">Joel Stockstill</a>'s wife, Amy, as she battles this terrible sickness. Wednesday night is the time for us to take the next step and join with our <a href="http://www.bethany.com">Bethany</a> family as they press in and declare her healing! HPC has cancelled all normal Wednesday night services and we are going to be joining Bethany at their South Campus in prayer.</p>

<p>Check out this post at <a href="http://www.mikehaman.com/?p=160">MikeHaman.com</a> for all the information. I hope to see you there, this is the body of Christ at it's strongest!</p>

        <p>The snow stays until I can walk around campus for a full week in shorts instead of jeans. Sorry, it's out of my control. Please make the best of this situation.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em></p>

<p>No, the snow is totally controlled by me. But I can't very well get rid of the snow when there are still days that I have to bundle up to walk to class at 7:30. So until it <em>really</em> warms up, the snow is here to stay.</p>

        <p>The always interesting roller coaster of life has been quite ride the last few weeks, and unfortunately that ride has steered me somewhat clear of free computer time. Hence, no blog posts. Regularity again soon, at least that's what I plan. <br /><br />But for right now, I want to encourage you to take a look around these two blogs! Really, if you respect me at all, you'll go check them out. They are awesome guys that I'm honored to be able to call my friends, and they both have quite an interesting perspective to offer. So go take a look.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.bluekardia.com"><img src="http://www.bluekardia.com/v2/images/logo.png" /></a> <a href="http://www.mikehaman.com"><img src="http://www.mikehaman.com/wp-content/themes/red-is-nice-20/images/header.jpg" height="100" width="304" /></a><br /><br /><br /><p class="poweredbyperformancing">Powered by <a href="http://scribefire.com/">ScribeFire</a>.</p></p>

        <p>I'm just laying down after the first session of the HPC Student Ministries leadership retreat, and my heart is truly full and overflowing tonight. I can't begin to describe the excitement I have about the people that I not only work alongside every day but also get the privileged of calling my friends.<br /><br />Brandon, Tabitha, Elton, Faith, Lawrence, Ben, Mark, Ashlyn, and Steve, you are the most incredible team I've ever gotten to work with. I couldn't pick a better group, you guys are like family.<br />Jason Laird, Mike Haman, Jason Ryder, Brian, Fazha, Brad, Rob, Sarah, David, I don't know where I'd be without people like this pouring into me and helping me grow.<br /><br />There are so many people that inspire and influence my life on a daily basis just by being around them. Friends like JP, Matt Laborde, Brandon B., Jamie, Dustin Alise, Andrew, Dustin Anderson, Jordan, and Adam - having you all as a part of my life makes this Christian walk, and even just everyday life so much easier and more enjoyable.<br /><br />I know there are so many more that I'm not thinking of right now, but it's late, so sweat me. I love you guys, I couldn't find a better group of people if i tried.</p>
