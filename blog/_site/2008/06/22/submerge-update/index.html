<p> Just wanted to share a quick pic from service last night (courtesy of Gabi Leblanc - twitter.com/gabrielle)  <br /><br /> Service was just incredible. God really show up in worship and showed Himself to many students in a new way. The message was strong and was just another step in impacting lives this weekend. its exciting stuff! <br /><br /> Also, just a side note, this is my first camp without J-Dog around, and he is greatly missed. Don't mean to get all sappy, but he is one of the people that really helped me get involved like I am at HPC. So, thanks Jason, wish you were here man!</p>
