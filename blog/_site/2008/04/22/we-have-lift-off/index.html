<p>Well it took long enough, but I've finally got a new look off the ground. Major man love goes out to <a href="http://www.bluekardia.com">SeÃ±or Song</a> for his wealth of web skillz; I'm an idiot otherwise. Anyway, the whole thing is from scratch and is hopefully the start of more stuff like this. It definitely won't be this long till we switch themes again.</p>

<p>There are still a few bugs so if you see anything quirky just leave me a comment. Thank ya.</p>

<p>Now, as always, off to revise a paper...</p>
