<p>Guys, check it out... In an effort to get one step ahead of the weather, we decided to move the venue for the <a href="http://healingplacechurch.org/men08/">HPC Men's Conference</a>, TONIGHT ONLY (Friday) to the Annex! Weâ€™ll be using both auditoriums so it's going to be rocking and there will be plenty of space available. Itâ€™s really going to be an incredible weekend, Ii you havenâ€™t signed up itâ€™s no big deal. Show up and sign up at the doors. You'd better be there!</p>
