<p>New stuff coming soon around here, hopefully a step forward. Trying to hurry and finish before school starts back up. Pointless post.</p>

<p>What are your plans for Spring Break? Easter? For me it's been school/helping around the annex/trying to build a new blog/relaxing a little.</p>

<p>If you don't have any plans this Easter and you're in the Baton Rouge area, I want to extend an invite to <a href="http://healingplacechurch.org/easter_schedule_08.php">Easter @ HPC</a>. I'll be around all weekend at Highland Road, it's definitely going to be an incredible weekend.</p>

<p>So, let's hear your plans for Easter and your magical spring break stories? Go go go.</p>
