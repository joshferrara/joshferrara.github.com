<p>The snow stays until I can walk around campus for a full week in shorts instead of jeans. Sorry, it's out of my control. Please make the best of this situation.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em></p>

<p>No, the snow is totally controlled by me. But I can't very well get rid of the snow when there are still days that I have to bundle up to walk to class at 7:30. So until it <em>really</em> warms up, the snow is here to stay.</p>
