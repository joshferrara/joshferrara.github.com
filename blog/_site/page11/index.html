        <p>Guys, check it out... In an effort to get one step ahead of the weather, we decided to move the venue for the <a href="http://healingplacechurch.org/men08/">HPC Men's Conference</a>, TONIGHT ONLY (Friday) to the Annex! Weâ€™ll be using both auditoriums so it's going to be rocking and there will be plenty of space available. Itâ€™s really going to be an incredible weekend, Ii you havenâ€™t signed up itâ€™s no big deal. Show up and sign up at the doors. You'd better be there!</p>

<p>You should know these faces by now. On the right is <a href="http://josh-bob.com/category/chris-in-class/">Chris</a> and <a href="http://josh-bob.com/2007/05/11/this-is-clay/">Clay</a> is on the left. What you see is them consuming some wonderful coffee as we study. What you don't see is the amazing coffee pot that brewed 12 cups in under 2 minutes. These are the days we will never forget.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Update:</em></p>

<p><em>Yes, the coffee pot was pretty astounding. That two minutes includes the prep work. Honestly, it almost seemed like the coffee was already made and it was just pouring it out. However, after investigating - and making 12 more cups of coffee - we realized that it was, in fact, just that amazing. </em></p>

<p> Over 300 students, gathered in one room, unified for one cause. I can't think of a better way to spend my Wednesday night.</p>

<p> This is a crowd after our Saturday Night service at HPC. They are are crowded around a swiming pool to celebrate with over 50 people that are making a declaration of faith and being baptized.
This is why we do what we do. Every graphic, every prayer, every single one of the dozens of Easter services... all for those that have not yet heard the message.
Praise God for seeing lives changed all around us.</p>

<p>Overalls. If you've been wondering, Chris has missed a few days of class. The funny thing is, on the ground at his feet, his oblong shaped backpack actually has a skillsaw in it.</p>

<p>Also, I wore shorts today, snow is gone.</p>
