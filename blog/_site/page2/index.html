        <p>Wow, how long has it been? Anyone still here? Well I won't start this with the usual blaming of Twitter and other social media that have "stolen my heart away from blogging" but I will say I've just neglected the blog for a few months, just one of those things I guess. However, it's been on my mind lately (its such a loyal blog, you know) and I've decided to try to be a little more regular with it. Whew, how many times have we been down that road?</p>

<p>Anyway, lots of things have been going on since there was a blizzard in the 225. God has done some incredible things in my life and the people around me - it's been quite an adventure, to say the least.We've had incredible Christmas services at <a href="http://www.healingplacechurch.org">HPC</a>, the start of a fresh new year, amazing Amplified services with Epic student ministries, and I've had the priviledge of going and being in some amazing positions and opportunities already this year!</p>

<p>Having just entered into the 3rd month of '09, it's been a whirlwind of a year so far. Just around the corner are some incredible things like <a href="http://servolution.org/7days/">7 Days of Servolution</a> that are sure to leave an awesome impact on our communities and those around the world.</p>

<p>One of those incredible chances that I'll have this year is the opportunity to go with the <a href="http://serve.healingplacechurch.org">Serve Team</a> leadership to Africa in May. As well as being able to go with the Serve crew, we'll be going with some Refuge highschool students and leaders. I can't tell you how humbling it is to be able to be a part of being thehands and feet of Jesus not only in our own community, but in a community across the globe. Absolutely mind-blowing!</p>

<p>So now begins the task of raising funds. It's easy for the task to look daunting, but I have seen God make a way time and time again. I don't want this first post back to be all about raising money for the trip, but if you are curious about what's going on with the trip, or if you are able to contribute at all (even $10 helps!) check out <a href="http://www.josh-bob.com/africa/">Josh-Bob.com/AFRICA
</a></p>

<p>You can also Chip In through the widget on the sidebar right here :)</p>

<p>Alright, this has gone on long enough. Hopefully this becomes more consistent! That's all for now.</p>

        <p>This Thanksgiving I've got more than usual to be thankful for. Thursday afternoon I was in a wreck just before we left for a family camping trip.</p>

<p>To make a long story short, I was trying to avoid someone that was drifting into my lane (too much turkey will do that), and I didn't see a truck that was turning in front of me (due to lack of tail-lights or turn-signals).</p>

<p>All I remember is the impact, and then my car being smokey (airbag debris) as it felt like I was riding the teacup ride at Disney. My car spun a full 180, and the truck that I hit did about the same, as well as flipping on it's side.</p>

<p>It's only by the grace and favor of God that everyone walked away from the accident. There were 7 passengers in the other vehicle, most small children without seatbelts, in a truck that seats maybe 5. They were able to climb out the back window of the cab with only minor cuts.</p>

<p>My car (God rest her soul) didn't fare very well. The hood was bent up, broke the windshield and was only stopped from hitting my face by the safety glass film. After a little work to get the door open I was able to get out with only some cuts and bruises to show for it, and able to help the other family out of their vehicle.</p>

<p>I would normally never blog about this in this sort of detail except I sat in a message this weekend that talked about divine interruptions, and I can't help but look at this as such. The officer that filed the report couldn't understand how my car withstood that kind of impact well enough to keep me safe. There is no replacement for functional seatbelts and airbags, but I can't deny the clear second chance, His hand on my life.</p>

<p>So, wear your seatbelts please, they actually work. But make sure you look for the interruptions placed in your life, I have to think they are more than just a little inconvenient.</p>
