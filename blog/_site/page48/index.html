        <p>Just a quick shout out to everyone that helped make RED an amazing night of worship and rocking out.. You guys completely blew me away! Dustin, Jarred, Leah and Salem really made it all flow beautifully! Not to mention Phillip, Trice(sorry if I butchered your name!), Adam, Jordan, and Jay, you guys are my heros.</p>

<p>Also, mad props to all the bands! No Shoes, you guys are awesome! We certainly need to do something again sometime soon.</p>

<p>Mark, Greg, Lawrence, Elton and of course Jonah, you guys rocked it out.</p>

<p>And of course, the Refuge Band, I wouldn't want to worship every week with anyone else.</p>

<p>K, hopefully I will have pictures up soon.</p>

<p>Thanks for everyone that came out, it was an awesome night!</p>

        <p>Ok, so everyone knows about the whole "The Way I See It" campaign at <a href="http://www.starbucks.com">Starbucks</a>, right? Cool. So, last night I was over there studying. Anyway, I usually take a look to see what insight my cup of coffee has to offer me, and it's usually much too poetic to do any real good. Tonight was a little different though, sooo I thought I'd share the wisdom, since after all, it was shared with me first. Here is the slamming quote from Jodi Picoult...</p>

<blockquote style="font-style: italic;">"What would you do for someone you love? Would you lie, cheat, steal? Break the law and call it justice? Would you say yes? Scream no? Would you kill? Would you give up your own life? Would you move mountains, swallow fire, keep a promise? Would you change the world? <span style="font-weight: bold;">Would you change yourself?</span>"</blockquote>


<p><i></i></p>

<p>I guess it reminded me of a message <a href="http://www.myspace.com/jasonlaird">Jason Laird</a> preached recently at Refuge. His main point was that so many times people are willing to die for what they believe in, but what God is asking is for us to <span style="font-style: italic;">live</span> for him. And usually, this is the harder road to walk.</p>

<p>Ok, that's all for now. I have tests all this week and next, including an Accounting test that I possibly failed. Pray!</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

        <p>In my quest for world domination and things of that sort I have recently made a major advance. I have, as of this morning I am the proud owner of <span style="font-size:130%;"><a href="http://www.josh-bob.com">josh-bob.com</a></span>.</p>

<p>Obviously, during these preliminary stages it will simply point to my blog, as most of my many fine domain names do. But some day soon, this could be the address where the world turns for their daily commands and instructions.</p>

<p>Or, it could just point to my blog for a long time.</p>

<p>Also, I apologize for the lack of posts lately. I lost my beloved camera phone to a puddle during the monsoon season and the absence of pictures to share with you makes me so sad that I can hardly write.</p>

<p>Until next time...</p>

        <p>This weekend I was able to head out to Hunt Correctional Center. Brandon, Tab, Donald, Mark, Rob, Pastor Dino and myself were asked to go and minister to them at one of their chapel meetings. It was really mind blowing experience to say the least. Not the first time I've done prison stuff, but it's just so eye opening everytime you are in a situation like that. God just makes it so apparent how much we have to worship him for in every moment of our life.</p>

<p>I could talk for a while about this, but instead, check out <a href="http://brandon-4point5.blogspot.com/2007/02/last-night-i-had-incredible-opportunity.html">this slammin' post</a> by <a href="http://brandon-4point5.blogspot.com">Brandon</a>.</p>

<p>Thats all for nowwwww!</p>
