<p>Last post before I head to bed...</p>

<p>This weekend the worship team played a song special that really spoke to me. If you know me pretty closely, you know I'm a sucker for basic truth in writing and I pretty much try to keep to that theme with the stuff that I write.</p>

<p>Anyway, this song is incredible. It was of course a hymn first and was later rearanged by Kristian Stanfill, I believe. If you don't think about anything else this Easter just check out these lyrics and take a listen. This isn't HPC Music, but I might have that soon...</p>

<p>Ok, really this time... Happy Easter, and goodnight.</p>

<blockquote><em>I hear the Savior say, â€œThy strength indeed is small;
Child of weakness, watch and pray, Find in Me thine all in all.â€

Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.

Lord, now indeed I find Thy power and Thine alone,
Can change the leperâ€™s spots And melt the heart of stone.

Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.

And when before the throne I stand in Him complete,
"Jesus died my soul to save" my lips shall still repeat

Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.

<strong>Oh Praise the one who paid my debt
And raised this life up from the dead!
Oh Praise the one who paid my debt
And raised this life up from the dead!</em>
