<p>I was going to mention this in my last post, but I have decided it deserves it's own post...</p>

<p>After watching Transformers: The Movie a total of 3 times this week, I decided to start a new category, possibly temporary, but I think it'll be fun.</p>

<p>The premise? If the concept of Transformers were real and there were AutoBots roaming among us, this (insert picture) would most likely be one.</p>

<p>Get it? Try to catch a transformer at their day job.</p>

<p>I'll try to keep up with this one, because it's obviously important stuff. Also, if you have a sighting feel free to post a link in a comment.</p>

<p>Here goes the first one...</p>

<p>I saw one of these today and couldn't help but think that it was just waiting to Transform...</p>
