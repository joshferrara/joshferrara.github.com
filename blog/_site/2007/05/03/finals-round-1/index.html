<p>I'm sitting in the middle of my final right now, and I thought I'd savor the moment.</p>

<p>I have officially passed MC2010, if I make a 25 or higher on this test. 2010 is the prereq for me to get in the Journalism school and achive my goal of a Marketing and Advertising double major.</p>

<p>If you haven't seen me toting around my AP Stylebook and writing papers left and right, you simply can't understand my joy in passing.
Props to Tab and Sarah for making it through alive with me.</p>

<p>Ok, I'm going finish the exam ;-)</p>
