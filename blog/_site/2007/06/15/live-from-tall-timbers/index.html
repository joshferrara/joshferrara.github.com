<p>Hey guys, real quick...</p>

<p>We're out here at Tall Timbers Retreat Center in Woodsworth, Louisiana for the first every LateNite retreat! If you're not here, shame on ya self!</p>

<p>I'm having phone/computer connectivity issues so I have no pictures yet, but I'll work on that tomorrow hopefully...</p>

<p>Anyway, we had some slamming worship tonight already, and I'm sure there is much more to come. The honorable Reverend <a href="http://www.mikehaman.com">Michael Haman</a> is teaching us all right now and bringing the fire! Speaking of... I'm gonna go finish listening to the message! Hope you're all having a great weekend, I know mine is already off to an awesome start.</p>
