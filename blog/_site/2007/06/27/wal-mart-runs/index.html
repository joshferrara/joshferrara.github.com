<p> So, we're having a BBQ tomorrow and we need plenty of food. Naturaly, Greg and I decided to make a late night journey to a distant Wal-Mart for a grocery run.
By the way, tonight was the first highschool service at camp, and it was absolutely amazing. God showed up in many kids lives already. I love it. More to come!</p>
