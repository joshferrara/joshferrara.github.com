<p>Just a quick shout out to everyone that helped make RED an amazing night of worship and rocking out.. You guys completely blew me away! Dustin, Jarred, Leah and Salem really made it all flow beautifully! Not to mention Phillip, Trice(sorry if I butchered your name!), Adam, Jordan, and Jay, you guys are my heros.</p>

<p>Also, mad props to all the bands! No Shoes, you guys are awesome! We certainly need to do something again sometime soon.</p>

<p>Mark, Greg, Lawrence, Elton and of course Jonah, you guys rocked it out.</p>

<p>And of course, the Refuge Band, I wouldn't want to worship every week with anyone else.</p>

<p>K, hopefully I will have pictures up soon.</p>

<p>Thanks for everyone that came out, it was an awesome night!</p>
