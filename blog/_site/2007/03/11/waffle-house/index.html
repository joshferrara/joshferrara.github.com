<p>This has quickly become my Sunday morning tradition. Of course, usually Mark Bordelon is my breakfast date (don&#39;t tell Katherine), but we changed up the schedule this weekend so he is at the annex and nobody at Highland Road quite appreciates the between service meal like Mark and myself.</p>

<p>In other news, we&#39;ve had 3 slammin&#39; services this weekend already, and the 10 and 12 look like they are going to follow suit. Pastor has been emphasizing our focus on missions this year as a church family and its really exciting to hear about the things God is doing this year already. On top of all that we&#39;re getting to partner with some other amazing churches like Hillsong, Joyce Meyer Ministries, Church of the Highlands just to name a few.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pumped about what God is letting me be a part of at HPC and 2007 is already shaping up to be a year where many people are going to be touched by God.</p>

<p>Also, I have the most amazing friends.</p>

<p>Alright, my food is almost here. Hope everyone is having an awesome weekend.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>
