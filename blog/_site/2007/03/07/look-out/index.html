So, I got a new phone today (about time, right?).</p>

<p>Anyway, it s a nice little Blackjack.</p>

<p>Best part being I can use its high-speed internet and tether it to my laptop and access anything anywhere :)</p>

<p>Yeah yeah yeah, nerd alert.</p>

<p>Anyway, lots of picture posts coming soon.</p>

<p>Peace.</p>
