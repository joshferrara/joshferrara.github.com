<p>For those of you that tried to get on yesterday you probably saw the ugly side of site maintenance. Anyway, I got halfway through some server-side updates annnnnd had to go to practice :)</p>

<p>Anyway, should be good now, everything is nice and fresh, and working faster than ever. As always, special thanks to <a href="http://www.bluekardia.com">Dr. Song</a> for his web love and guidance.</p>

<p>So, how is your Christmas season going so far? Any exciting things? I'm just happy to be out of school and seeing my friends.</p>

<p>Blah blah, pointless post. Merry Christmas :)</p>
