<p>Added some new pictures to the Photo section from the Italy trip, you should check them out! And tomorrow with any luck I'll add some of my recent phone pictures.</p>

<p>Sooo, check out the photo section!</p>

<p>And here's just a little teaser... I snuck this photo inside the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catacombs_of_Rome">Roman catacombs</a>, when we weren't supposed to be taking pictures(notice the shoot-from-the-hip angle), so don't tell the monk security guards...</p>
