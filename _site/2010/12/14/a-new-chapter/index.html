        <p>So, last year, around this time I decided that since I spend my days crafting WordPress beauty for others, I would begin spending my nights crafting the WP creation that is my own blog. For about a month I argued with myself over design, slowly choosing elements I liked, features I wanted, service I wanted to include, etc. So much easier to work when the client isn't yourself!</p>

<p>After a month I soft-launched the theme that you see now, with a few exceptions. At the beginning of 2010, the page included a link to a 'photo of the day' blog, as well as a Tumblr for what I thought would be a niche between WP and Twitter. Big Mistake! Too much content to was needed to keep the site looking alive! So after about a month, all 3 aspects of the blog were nearly lifeless. I'll admit, part of it is because I just resented Tumblr for not being like WordPress. What do you mean I have to edit themes ONLINE? I can't edit files in an editor? Needless to say, I have repented and turned back to what I've known all along with work, WordPress is the way.</p>

<p>So now, a new year is starting, and I'm making a new attempt to chronicle what happens in my life.To catch you up to speed, I thought I'd give you a one paragraph synopsis. I call it "2010: a josh odyssey". Here goes:</p>

<p>I started the year taking 2 winter session classes at <a href="http://lsu.edu">LSU</a> so I could graduate before turning 21. In the spring semester I took 21 hours, again, to speed up the graduation process. It was the hardest semester of my life. Long nights, group projects, real work, and balancing it all with running <a href="http://ferraracreative.com">my own company</a> to make a living and pay for school. Graduated in May within 2 weeks of turning 21. Finished with a 3.8 GPA (doesn't matter) and $0 of debt (matters a lot). A week later I took the <a href="http://twitter.com/gabrielleeee">girl of my dreams</a> to New Orleans and got down on one knee; she said "yes!" 2 weeks later I started working at <a href="http://gatorworks.net">Gatorworks</a> in addition to running <a href="http://ferraracreative.com">Ferrara Creative</a> (steady jobs impress chicks and their parents). In June we went to Cape Cod for 2 weeks on vacation. In October we went to New Orleans again, but this time we <a href="http://joshandgabi.com">got married</a>. After the wedding we decided to go to Europe for 2 weeks. That was fun. Then we came back home. Now we live in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Prairieville,+LA&amp;sll=30.330275,-91.009695&amp;sspn=0.017187,0.033023&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Prairieville,+Ascension,+Louisiana&amp;z=15">Prairieville</a> with a happy condo of our own, more kitchen appliances than we know what to do with, and a jolly fish named <a href="http://instagr.am/p/jhzy/">KatieBob</a>. The End.</p>
