        <p>Just took one of the hardest exams all semester, and I actually feel pretty good about it. Honestly, it's not a hard subject. American History. I've just been delaying this class because I despise essay exams. I know the information just fine. I have two barriers keeping me from excelling however. Numero uno is the simple fact that I have terrible handwriting. It really would make you cringe, it's bad. The second of my essay woes is the fact that I absolutely can't stand writing that isn't organized. And when I'm forced to write 3 or 4 pages of information in a 50 minute block, it tends to be disorganized. It's all correct, mind you. Just not organized. And that really irks me.</p>

<p>Anyway, it's over. That was the last big one till finals start, so I've got a little bit of relaxation time. Haha, that was a cute thought. I love my busy life :)</p>

<p>I may or may not be heading up to Fusion this weekend, still yet to hear the official word!</p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://aimeecait.wordpress.com">Aimee</a> is coming home <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_21">soooooooon</a> and I can't wait.Â  Just a Christmas break, of course, but it's still going to be good to see her! Trip to Tennessee anyone? Oh yes. It's crazy how fast half a year has almost passed. It's crazy how God will relocate things in your life, physically as far as people, and spiritually as far as shaking up your perspective, and even when it seems like chaos with no rhyme or reason, over time He has consistently proven that He has got my back. How long is it going to take me to really look at the bigger picture? I pray I never stop letting Him reveal Himself to me like this though. Lord, don't let me become numb to your strength in my life!</p>

<p>Sorry to keep postponing the Italy pictures and posts, I promise they are coming, they just have to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simmering">simmer</a> a bit.</p>

<p>Ciao for now...</p>
