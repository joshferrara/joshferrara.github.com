        <p>Alright, first I want to apologize that I do alot of shouting-out lately. I understand that it can be taken as a lame excuse for blogging, but I assure you, I'm not trying to pass it off as such. I'm amazed daily at the amazing people that I am blessed to work with and know on a daily basis. That being said... Sweat me.</p>

<p>First off, go check out my boy Ryan Miller aka <a href="http://www.ryanmiller.wordpress.com">MILLERACHI</a>! I haven't known him for long but I know he's got some good stuff to say, so check him out, he's a new blogger! Give him some love.</p>

<p>Ok, this one is half-way a shout-out, but really I need to brag on someone.</p>

<p>Most of my readers know or know off Jason Laird aka <a href="http://jasonlaird.com">Tweezy</a>. For those of you that don't know, he is the high-school pastor at <a href="http://www.healingplacechurch.org">HPC</a>. He's slightly throw'd off for Jesus, if you know what I mean. (it's a good thing, don't hide your kids)</p>

<p>Like I said, I'm blessed to be able to call him a friend and leader in my life. But he did something last night that really impressed me. It wasn't some huge sermon (although if you were at <a href="http://refuge.healingplacechurch.org">Refuge</a> then you heard his slamming message which was, not ironically, what I'm about to talk about) But no, this wasn't anything super spiritual. We were sitting in McDonalds after a meeting last night (yeah, we roll to MD's for meetings at HPC) and the good Doctor Tweeze was heading to the door on his way home. I mentioned to someone that he had on a pretty rockin belt and buckle. Anyway, he heard his name but not the comment. As soon as I told him that I was just complimenting his belt, without thinking he pulled it off, handed it to me with a quick "love you man" and headed on his way home.</p>

<p>If you have ever doubted his sincerity, I implore you to rethink that opinion. I know that it's not a huge deal, but it speaks volumes about his heart, and more importantly the DNA of the church! This freak will give you the clothes of his back (or waist) if he thinks it will even slightly make a difference in your life! That is what it is all about! Are you willing to do whatever it takes?</p>

<p>We have the solution that the world is in desperate need of. We have this solution in our Savior. Do you value it as such in your life? I know I go many days where I certainly don't. Revolution will not take place until the revolutionaries believe that they have something worth changing the world for! Are you willing to do what it takes? Are you willing to sacrifice everything and <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:2-8;&amp;version=50;">count it all joy</a>? Do you believe in the value that you hold? Do you believe it enough to give it away?</p>
