        <p>Alright, it seems everyone is doing this these days, but I certainly don't want to recieve to much flack about this ( so shut it, seriously). A decent amount of my blog viewers are non-HPCers. This is for you.</p>

<p><strong>This is a compound shout-out.</strong></p>

<p>First of all, I have to give some love to <a href="http://kayceesmith.blogspot.com">Kaycee Smith</a>. For those of you that don't know, she is one of the interns at <a href="http://www.healingplacechurch.org">HPC</a> in the <a href="http://healingplacechurch.org/elevate.php">Elevate</a> program. However, that's not why she is recieving attention right now. Since she created her blog, she has had around 120 visitors to her site. in the 3 days since I've been added to her blogroll, I have consistently had 12 visitors a day that were refered to my site from Kaycee's blog! You do the math. Anyway, I enjoy her blog, so you should check it out!</p>

<p>This next blogger really caught me off guard. It has quickly earned a place in my top 10 most viewed blogs. He's got an awesome writing style and you definitely need to check it out! Ladies and Gentleman, let me introduce to you... <a href="http://www.areowebee.com">Rob Gros</a>.</p>

<p>Now this blogger has become one of my best friends in the last year. I love his heart and passion for worship and God. Last night I was able to catch a glimps of him and a friend leading worship at a local youth group and I was blown away. If you are looking for a young guy with some awesome insight on life, please check out <a href="http://refugejturn.blogspot.com/">Jamie Phillips</a>.</p>

<p>And now, a story.</p>

<p>I am a student in the field of <a href="http://www.manship.lsu.edu">Mass Communication</a> and media at <a href="http://www.lsu.edu">LSU</a>. One of the things that we are constantly having reinforced into us is the fact that we are, in a sense, gate-keepers of information. Whether it is an editor of a newspaper, a producer of a movie, or a book publisher, there is a gate-keeper who decided whether or not to let that information past them. Very few things will ever be heard about on a wide-scale level if there is no media used to push it. This position as gate-keepers is one that is often not as high of a priority in the media realm as it should be.</p>

<p>One of the growing concerns amoung media ethics experts is the issue of bloggers. There is no gate-keeper. No accountability to a large extent. Someone can slander another's name, and there are no restrictions or consequences.</p>

<p>However, this is not the case in my life. I would like to thank <a href="http://michaelgriffis.com">Michael Griffis</a> and <a href="http://jpbrumfield.com">JP Brumfield</a>, you guys are my gate-keepers. Not so much in a controling way, but I know you hold a high standard in blogs, and it makes me keep the content up.</p>

<p>I salute you. <a href="http://michaelgriffis.com">Griffis</a>, blogger for the people. <a href="http://jpbrumfield.com">JP</a>, blog prince of blogorhea.</p>
