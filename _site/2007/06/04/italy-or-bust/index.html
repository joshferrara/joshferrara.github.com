I apologize for the extreme overload of posts about the Italy trip but it has sort of consumed my daily workings the past few days. Anyway, one last reminder for now... Please keep <a href="http://hpcitaly.blogspot.com">our team</a> in your prayers this summer as we prepare and raise funds for our trip.</p>

<p>I'm so excited that we have the opportunity to show God's love to people that regularly get overlooked for the simple reason that they are not suffering like children in Africa or any other "true mission fields", when in reality, they are lacking the biggest thing we have to share, just as much as any third world country. They are educated people, a good portion of them even fairly wealthy, but they look at the gospel and the story of our Saviour as fairy-tales and mythology. What an awesome opportunity to shine His light! There are two major groups of people that need God to touch them: The first group has never heard the name of Jesus. The second group has heard, but think they don't need it or don't need to care. The second group is prevalent in Italy. I've really had this group on my heart since I've been at <a href="http://www.lsu.edu">LSU</a> this past year because everywhere you turn there are very educated people who don't know and accept the price that He paid on the cross. Sorry to get preachy, but let's be real, you know you love it and you love me.</p>

<p>These things have really been on my heart, especially in the light of <a href="http://aimeecait.blogspot.com/">Aimee</a> taking her first trip to London to see the area that she will be living and working for the next year of her life. That really just woke me up to start re-examining my own actions, as far as my faith goes. How many things come down the pipe from God and we completely miss them and don't TAKE ACTION? It's so awesome to me that she is taking action on this opportunity, regardless of if the whole plan is visible or clear. I pray that God stirs me to take action as much as I possibly can towards the opportunities that come across my path.</p>

<p>God has put places like Italy on my heart and the hearts of our team and I can't wait to see what He accomplishes through us!</p>
