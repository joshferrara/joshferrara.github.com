        <p>Ok, first of all, I'm totally not trying to start off with a title that will make this sound like a deep and inspiring post, because I doubt it will be, and that's not my agenda. But I do hope it will at least be thought-provoking, because that is what the past few days have been to me, and I simply need to write.</p>

<p>I don't know if anyone has seen this on the news in the last few days but this happened Thursday. Here is a <a href="http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/4981076.html">clipping</a> from the local paper...</p>

<blockquote>Deputies arrested six people who were with a 16-year-old boy believed to have shot and killed himself during a reported game of Russian roulette Wednesday at his home in Prairieville, Ascension sheriffâ€™s Lt. Col. Paul Robert said.      Robert said the victim, Jacob White, 15005 Meadow Drive, and six of his older friends were playing Russian roulette while they were smoking marijuana.</blockquote>


<p>If you're like me and not quite clear on that definition, here goes... <blockquote>Russian roulette is a deadly game of chance in which a participant spins a revolver cylinder loaded with one bullet, then aims the pistol at his head and pulls the trigger, attempting to tempt fate.</blockquote>
This has messed with me on so many levels this week. To think that a young life can be taken in a situation with such carelessness and immaturity is one thing, but to me it symbolizes something much worse; a growing lack of understanding of a human life in our culture. I mean, I know we hear about things like this every day, and I know this is impacting me more because this is a crowd that I, through certain musical ventures have been around and acquainted with some time ago. But think about it... A 16 year old kid, in more than one situation that he should never have been around, much less immersed in. He's in an altered state of mind, and he mistakes something of eternal relevance for something to be taken lightly. He was deceived into feeling that taking even a slight chance on his life was acceptable. I understand this was under the influence of drugs, but that is even more to my point; yet another situation that he was in that could or should have been avoided with a simple thought process. It kills me that a life can be devalued -- even if just for a moment -- to this level. I have always thought that for Satan to convince or persuade a human being to take their own life or convince them that it's ok to trash it is one of the highest of accomplishments for him, but this is mind blowing to me.</p>

<p>Now, contrast this with another story.</p>

<p>Greg and Lori Smith.. their <a href="http://www.prayforhannah.org/">daughter</a> has spent a week in ICU at Ochsner in NOLA with a heart malady. Satan is  again trying to steal the precious gift of a human life, but this time it's different... No, the value of this life isn't greater. In this situation, there is someone, many someones that understand the value of this human life. In the past week I have witnessed an overwhelming response in prayer and support for this couple as their daughter faces this health issue. I have see more people than ever before get on their face and call to God on behalf of this precious little girl, this highly valuable human life. See, the difference here doesn't lie in the value of a human life, no... this is an issue of perception. A missunderstanding of the worth of a human life.</p>

<p>It tears me apart that one group of people can find incredible unity in the fact that they know beyond a shadow of a doubt that this little girl, a young life, is not only one of value, but one of purpose.. but at the same time, there is a culture that is missing this completely. They aren't oblivious to life and death, but they simply don't grasp the immense price tag on a life.</p>

<p>I understand that I'm also writing this with the belief in a Saviour who died for my sins, but I personally believe this to be true even if you strip the faith from it entirely.</p>

<p>I hate to see situations like this happening so close to home, and I hope you'll join me keep the families of both of these young people in your thoughts and prayers, but more than that, I hope all of this -- every situation around us -- begins to serve as a wake-up call to a generation that is on a fast track to loosing the understanding of the valuable thing that a life is. I know it's certainly woken me up to begin thinking about every aspect of how I live my every day life.</p>

<p>I know this is a heavy issue, and I would have normally just waited to post this until after the holidays etc. But I think this is a red flag for all of us to take a second look at what this whole season is about, and what it actually is that we have to be thankful for.</p>

<p>I hope this is finding you in an amazing and blessed holiday season.
Merry Christmas and God Bless!</p>
