# The personal site and blog of Josh Ferrara

This is an ever-evolving work in progress, but it has more than a few nice touches:

* Retina-ready images and social icons
* Retina-optimized font usage (Open Sans)
* CSS transition magic
* Blog layout and single post templates
* [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) toopltip goodness
