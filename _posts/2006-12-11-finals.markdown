<span style="font-style: italic;" class="std_font"><b>"I'm Safer On An Airplane"</b>

It happened then, it happens now
They let you in, they let you down
And it feels like we can't get out
And it feels like hell

I think I'm safer in an airplane
I think I'm safer with my lungs filled up smoke
I think I'm safer on a jet-way
Than a world without hope

The day came in, the day went out
And not a bit of peace was spoken about
And it feels like a suicidal world
And it feels like hell

I think I'm safer in an airplane
I think I'm safer if I run through the streets
I think I'm safer on a jet-way
Than a world without peace

Oh, what arms will stretch out when they've had enough?
Oh, when they are tired, folding up on us...

I think I'm safer on an airplane
(I think I'm safer on an airplane)
I think I'm safer in the sky up above
I think I'm safer on the jet-way
Than a world without...

I think I'm safer on an airplane
(I think I'm safer on an airplane)
I think I'm safer in the sky up above
I think I'm safer on the jet-way
Than a world without love

</span><span class="std_font">Yeah, not super profound, just simple truth. I like that lately. God's been  showing me that most</span> truth isn't really something that's hard to wrap your head around anyway. More on this later, Calculus studying right now. Also, hopefully in the next week I'll find time to talk about the amazing dream I had last week. Actually, it was just God. Really crazy. More to come...<span style="font-style: italic;" class="std_font"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span>
