Ok, I just realized that I haven't done this yet, and since I'm just sitting in class, I figured it would be the perfect time.  ;)

If you are looking for something to read that will make you think, head over to <a href="http://jasonlaird.blogspot.com">Jason Laird's blog</a>.

<a href="http://jasonlaird.blogspot.com">Tweezy</a> is someone that God worked through in a crazy way in my life, and one of the biggest reasons I am involved like I am at <a href="http://www.healingplacechurch.org">HPC</a>. On top of all that, he's so darn cute, and you'll never hear a pastor bust a rhyme quite like him...

So, head on over to his blog and show the brother some love!


In other news, <a href="http://www.lsu.edu">school</a> is back in my life again... I know, it was only spring break, but it was quite relaxing! So, what did you do on your spring break? Or is yours this week instead? Let me know how your Easter was too!

Cheers.
