I should probably wait until I have more time to ponder this and make it more poetic and such, but I've just got to share it.
It seems like every new opportunity to travel and meet new people brings a new method for God to display not only his love for us, but His willingness to saturate our lives with it if we will walk in it. Follow me here...
We could have had many reactions to arriving in Sicily, from frustration to apathy, it was all possible and very understandable. But we chose to simply walk in the only love we knew... "ciao", and a smile. Since my first double-kiss in the homeland, God has continued to pour favor and compassion, into us and the people we are meeting.
You would be absolutely amazed if you had just sat in the conversation Tabitha, Mark Bordelon, and myself just sat in at lunch. To start with zero knowledge and be able to communicate with almost anyone in the building is incredible! We talk about everything from music to school. Mark and I even taught them how to "TIGER BAIT!"
All this to say that God will let you do the seemingly impossible if you will simply choose to walk in His love and share it with everyone around you.
Thank you again for your prayers, they are much appreciated!
