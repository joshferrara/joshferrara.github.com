Alright, so I locked the previous post, no more commenting, sorry it was getting a little out of hand! And I delete a few that were a little harsh. It's interesting to see what everyone's opinions are. For those that are wondering, I have spoken with the author of the original post and we both agree that the flow of ideas is an awesome thing! That being said, you still have to be able to isolate the idea from the person who proposed it. Bashing people <em>for</em> their ideas = not cool.

I love how passionate everyone has been, and I really think that kind of attitude is what we need to keep us from the perils of mindless marketing that churches are in danger off.Â  You guys rock.
