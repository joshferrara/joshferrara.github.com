God is really moving in some unbelievable ways here... Tyler Cheramie and myself were able to pray with about 5 guys within a 30 minute period. We've seen people breakdown, beg for prayer, accept Christ, and we've also had cursing and hatred thrown around. And yet, I've never felt more compassion than I do now. The exciting thing about it is that even though the growth has come during this trip, it's not something that is temporary. I pray that God only continues to grow inside of me an understanding of the value of one of his kids. I want my heart to break for what breaks my Father's heart. I want to go beyond charity, this is not an option. This is justice. It is what we are called to do.

I'm definitely posting again tonight. We have a late night outreach later, and we're expecting some awesome stuff. Pray!
