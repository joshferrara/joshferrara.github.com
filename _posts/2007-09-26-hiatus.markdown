Nah, I'm back again. Things are crazy around my life lately, so of course the first the to go is.... sleep. And then blog time. But I'm working on it, oh well, right?

One thing I know I'm excited about is the Late Nite Trip to Italy, which leaves a week from today. That is 7 days. I'm stoked. It's going to be awesome the crazy things that we're getting to be a part of, and also all the amazing people I get to travel with.

Also, if you were wondering when the whole "Livecam" thing was going to come into play, you're in luck. Starting next Wednesday, you will want to always check it anytime you visit my blog! Anytime I have internet and we're playing or having a service, I'm gonna have it on so you can see what's up. Weird, I know. Sort of out of the ordinary, sure. But I think it might be the next step in moblogging. "Live from the field.." kinda flow, you know?

Alright, wellllll that is all for now!

Oh, also, Epic was this past weekend, (yet another reason I haven't blogged or studied as much as I should), and it was incredible! so, here is a picture for you to enjoy. The Student Ministries Band, doing our thing...
