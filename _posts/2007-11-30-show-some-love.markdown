Alright, you may or may not know this, but with some recent tech troubles, JP Brumfield's blog has been out of service for around a week now. Not to worry, calm down, comfort your children, it's back online.

Take a second and go show him some love, I hear he's got some pretty awesome posts brewing, so you should definitely check out his blog.
