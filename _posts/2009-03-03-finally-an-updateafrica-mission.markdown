Wow, how long has it been? Anyone still here? Well I won't start this with the usual blaming of Twitter and other social media that have "stolen my heart away from blogging" but I will say I've just neglected the blog for a few months, just one of those things I guess. However, it's been on my mind lately (its such a loyal blog, you know) and I've decided to try to be a little more regular with it. Whew, how many times have we been down that road?

Anyway, lots of things have been going on since there was a blizzard in the 225. God has done some incredible things in my life and the people around me - it's been quite an adventure, to say the least.We've had incredible Christmas services at <a href="http://www.healingplacechurch.org">HPC</a>, the start of a fresh new year, amazing Amplified services with Epic student ministries, and I've had the priviledge of going and being in some amazing positions and opportunities already this year!

Having just entered into the 3rd month of '09, it's been a whirlwind of a year so far. Just around the corner are some incredible things like <a href="http://servolution.org/7days/">7 Days of Servolution</a> that are sure to leave an awesome impact on our communities and those around the world.

One of those incredible chances that I'll have this year is the opportunity to go with the <a href="http://serve.healingplacechurch.org">Serve Team</a> leadership to Africa in May. As well as being able to go with the Serve crew, we'll be going with some Refuge highschool students and leaders. I can't tell you how humbling it is to be able to be a part of being thehands and feet of Jesus not only in our own community, but in a community across the globe. Absolutely mind-blowing!

So now begins the task of raising funds. It's easy for the task to look daunting, but I have seen God make a way time and time again. I don't want this first post back to be all about raising money for the trip, but if you are curious about what's going on with the trip, or if you are able to contribute at all (even $10 helps!) check out <a href="http://www.josh-bob.com/africa/">Josh-Bob.com/AFRICA

Alright, this has gone on long enough. Hopefully this becomes more consistent! That's all for now.
