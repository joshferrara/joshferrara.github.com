It's usually not a welcome thing (unless you are like one of my many HPC compadres who have today OFF), But waking up on a Monday morning and finding that you are struggling with a cold or something of that nature... it's just not good.

Soooo, we take lots of AirBorne and start of the day. Right? Right.

Also, I'm so curious what someone's explanation of global warming would sound like on a cold day in April...

Also again, check out <a href="http://aimeecait.blogspot.com/2007/04/and-im-christian.html">this post</a> by my best friend <a href="http://aimeecait.blogspot.com">Aimee Gwaltney</a>! She is so much better at expressing her thoughts on any subject in words. I'm totally jealous.
