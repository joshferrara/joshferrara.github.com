So this is me trying to make myself feel better about the massive amounts of time that I spend working with school stuff.

Check out <a href="https://joshferrara.com/mc2015/index.html" target="_blank">this site</a>. It's something I had to put together for one of my classes.

Please don't hate. I actually only spent about 30 minutes on the design of the site. It's mainly to host the other projects we completed in the class this year.

Anyway, take a look see and tell me if you want to be an Advertising student like me!

Two (2) more weeks people, and we are finished for the summer. I don't know about you, but that can't come soon enough.

That's all for now. Show some love.
