Well it took long enough, but I've finally got a new look off the ground. Major man love goes out to <a href="http://www.bluekardia.com">SeÃ±or Song</a> for his wealth of web skillz; I'm an idiot otherwise. Anyway, the whole thing is from scratch and is hopefully the start of more stuff like this. It definitely won't be this long till we switch themes again.

There are still a few bugs so if you see anything quirky just leave me a comment. Thank ya.

Now, as always, off to revise a paper...
