So, everyone has to do something crazy during finals week, right? Well I chose to shrug some study time to head to New Orleans to check out MuteMath, and they did not disappoint.

This was the 5th time I've seen them and I am amazed every time at their ability to top themselves, consistently.

The only thing that could make the night better was the great company I enjoyed the show with. Having their faces rock right alongside me were <a href="http://aimeecait.blogspot.com">AimeeCA!T</a>, my brother and dad, <a href="http://www.friedriches.net/blog">Andrew</a>, <a href="http://brandonbourgeois.blogspot.com/">Brandon B.</a>, Dustin Anderson, and Jared Ray.

That, ladies and gents, was a show.
