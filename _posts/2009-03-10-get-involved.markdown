I've been really impacted the past few weeks by the incredible amount of generosity, but also the huge level of unity that I've seen in my life. I've seen people with lives, needs and situations of their own give of their time AND finances to help support a college student as he tries to make his way to Africa, and I've seen people raising money for mission trips of their own go out of their way to support others.
<h2><strong>So here it is. </strong></h2>
I challenge you to <strong>get involved</strong> in the incredible things going on around HPC and the globe. This isn't your time to travel? <strong>Give.</strong> Maybe you are saving for a trip yourself? <strong>Give.</strong> We all have 10 bucks to spare, it can go a long way. We are all in this together. We must support one another!

Here are 6 incredible opportunities for you to get involved in something larger than yourself. <strong>PRAY &amp; GIVE.</strong>

<h2>Go for it.</h2>
These are people that, just like me and you, will not be able to <strong>go &amp; do</strong> without support. Your support. So hunt them down, email them, call them, Twitter them, <strong>just contact them</strong>, <em>pray</em> for them, and help <em>send</em> them as <strong>tools of love</strong>.
