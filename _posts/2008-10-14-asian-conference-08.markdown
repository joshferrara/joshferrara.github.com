I got to be a part of a really cool event Sunday evening in Baton Rouge. The Epic Worship team and Jason Laird were invited to lead worship and be a part of a one night event where 6 different Asian churches in our community came together for a time of fellowship, fun, and food (can you say sushi?)

Really awesome event to be able to join in as God tears down walls and builds relationships between the diverse family of believers! We even got invited to join the fellowship next time!

Here are some pics from the night!
