Ok, so I've had one of my craziest weeks of school ever, but it is in the past now. I'm definitely suffering from tunnel vision right now. Italy Mission Trip is right around the corner. Ok, it's tomorrow. Ah God is awesome. Why me? How in the world have I been chosen for this amazing opportunity. Praise God for trusting me enough to place me in positions to spread His love and scatter His word across the globe!

As you can expect, there will be many blog moments to come, starting tomorrow morning. Also, the "<a href="https://joshferrara.com/livecam/">LIVECAM</a>" page is going to become active hopefully! My plan is to have it go live whenever there is a worship service in Italy. I'll let you know in advance when to be looking on the page, but just be ready. And no, this isn't to make rockstars out of our worship team, I just know that personally, I love seeing and hearing about the awesome things this "family" is able to be a part of.

Keep your prayer shoes on for our entire team, for wisdom in decision making for our leaders and guides, for effectiveness in His plan, for unity in our group, and most of all that we plant good seed!
