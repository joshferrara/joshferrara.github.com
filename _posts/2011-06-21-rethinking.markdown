You may blame it on [Twitter](http://twitter.com), you may call it apathy, but the truth of the matter is that blogging hasn't been a high priority in my life during this season.

I'm taking some time to rethink what I want out of this site, and what I want to share through it. I'm not sure if it'll end up similar to what the site currently is, and I'm not even sure how long it'll take. Either way, I want something less forced. I want a medium that fits well into my life. We'll see.
