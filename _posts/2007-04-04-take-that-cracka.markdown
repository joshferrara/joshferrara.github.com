We had a little get together today for Joe Causey at Brunet's. Joe will be leaving
us this week to go do freelance work in Nashville and work with some pretty neat
people.

If you have met Joe you know that he will be missed greatly at HPC.

He's a great guy. Even though he's going to be working with rockstars he still made
time to come have lunch with the little people. He even brought along his Barbie
laptop to show us.
