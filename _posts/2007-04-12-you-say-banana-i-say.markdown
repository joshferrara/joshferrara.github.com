The weekend before Easter we took a grand ol' trip up to the <a href="http://www.healingplacechurch.org/index.php?campus_id=5">St. Francisville Campus</a> of <a href="http://www.healingplacechurch.org">HPC</a> to serve it up at their <a href="http://www.healingplacechurch.org/flier.php?id=258">Pathfinders</a> service Sunday night.

When I say we, I mean myself, <a href="http://jpbrumfield.com">JP</a>,  <a href="http://brandonbourgeois.blogspot.com/">Brandon</a>, <a href="http://katiefontenot.blogspot.com">Katie</a>, <a href="http://jmenck.wordpress.com">J. Menck</a>annnd more that I am probably forgeting!

Katie rocked the pulpit.. or music stand.... anyway, it was cool stuff, I was proud of the whole team. And I came away with an awesome catch phrase from Katie... "Some people say banana, some people say... Boh-noh-noh...?"

It was classic.

Anyway, after the service <a href="http://michaelgriffis.blogspot.com">Griffis</a>, <a href="http://gmohnay.blogspot.com/index.html">Gabi</a>, and the <a href="http://www.healingplacechurch.org/flier.php?id=176">St. Fran Refuge</a> crew came over to hang out and head to eat at Sonny's Pizza.

Good stuff.
