<p class="storycontent">oh what things my blog could tell you, that is, if my phone blogging was still working. However, itâ€™s been down for a while, so again, I apologize for the major lack of posts lately.

Leah has urged me in the middle of a meeting to awaken my blogging side, so here I am.

A lot has happened lately. Iâ€™ve been to Birmingham and back, a retreat in New Orleans and a Retreat in Jackson. Iâ€™ve spent a lot of time at HPC, and not much time sleeping. Iâ€™ve also had some friends that mean alot to me move away.

Well some good news is that Iâ€™ve got my mobile blogging off the ground again, so hopefully weâ€™ll be working good now!

Iâ€™m leaving tomorrow morning to head out with some of my favorite people in the world to go to Houston, Texas to visit family of friends and see a Lifehouse and the Goo Goo Dolls show at the Woodlands.

Other than that, School has started annnnd I need your prayer as always. Italy is fast approaching and I definitely canâ€™t wait.

I hope the blogging world has been great the last few weeks. Iâ€™m backkkk.
