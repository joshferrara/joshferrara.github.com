Alright, So I got my photo album up and running. For the most part anyway. Still have a little work to do, but nothing most people will notice. Also, if you know of any good gallery plug-ins that are easier to incorporate into your theme, you should let me know!

Ok, that's all for now.

Btw, keep the Full-time <a href="http://www.healingplacechurch.org/elevate.php">Elevate</a> team in your prayers, they are leaving for Africa in 4 days now! Pray that God would use them to share His heart with the people that need it so much.
