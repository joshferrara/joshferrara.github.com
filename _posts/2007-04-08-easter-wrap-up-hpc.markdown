If you weren't there (shame shame), this weekend was absolutely amazing at <a href="http://www.healingplacechurch.org">HPC</a>! With 7 services at our Highland Road Campus alone, and around 15 more at our other campuses around the globe, the story of His sacrifice was definitely celebrated and shared in an awesome way.

I was blessed to be able to take part in the services at our main campus this year. If you have ever had thoughts of doubt towards the multi-campus, large church approach, I really urge you to come visit for a weekend. I was absolutely blown away again by the atmosphere that our staff and volunteer teem provided for anyone seeking an encounter with God this weekend. But of course, none of that amounts to much if God doesn't show up. And show up He did.

The altar was flooded during every single service with people who made decisions for Jesus for the first time. There is nothing quite like someone making that decision on Easter Sunday morning...

Pastor <a href="http://dinorizzo.com">Dino</a> delevered a strong and clear message that definitely made me think during each service. Praise God for a church that is blessed with a pastor that hears from God!

This weekend was a huge success for the kingdom!

Props to the band guys and gals, you are awesome! <a href="http://jasonryder.blogspot.com">J-Dawg</a>, your song was rocking bro. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/joecausey">Joe</a>, I'm gonna miss you man! We'll be up there to visit you soon enough I'm sure.

Also, much respect to my boy Doug Musso for showing up even the pastor!
