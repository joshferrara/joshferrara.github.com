God showed up in a very real way and really rocked some peoples worlds.

Amplified was absolutely amazing, Chad Daniel was used by God and the worship just flowed!

This was some of the most realistic changes in peoples lives that I've seen in a long time.

Ok, the food is almost here. I hope everyone is having a great weekend, I know mine was totally rockin.
