For those of you that tried to get on yesterday you probably saw the ugly side of site maintenance. Anyway, I got halfway through some server-side updates annnnnd had to go to practice :)

Anyway, should be good now, everything is nice and fresh, and working faster than ever. As always, special thanks to <a href="http://www.bluekardia.com">Dr. Song</a> for his web love and guidance.

So, how is your Christmas season going so far? Any exciting things? I'm just happy to be out of school and seeing my friends.

Blah blah, pointless post. Merry Christmas :)
