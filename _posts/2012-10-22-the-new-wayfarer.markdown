While shopping around for the perfect pair of Wayfarers recently, I noticed a few pairs marked with the label “New Wayfarer”, ever so subtly. I like to make informed purchases, so I decided to try to determine the difference between the Wayfarers I was initially shopping for and these New Wayfarers. Because obviously, [new is better](http://josh-bob.com/2012/08/14/my-name-is-josh-im-a-neophile/).

Here’s what I found, straight from the horses mouth:

> Ray-Ban New Wayfarer sunglasses are a slightly smaller interpretation on the most famous style in sunwear. The iconic Ray-Ban Wayfarer is immediately recognizable anywhere in the world. The Ray-Ban signature logo is displayed on both sculpted temples. The New Wayfarer flaunts a softer eye shape than the original and offers both classic and fashion bright color options. These sunglasses allow the wearer to enjoy a classic, celebrated style while adding their own individuality.

Ray Ban had a classic style, but they weren’t afraid to update it to fit a new generation. 

Don’t let your previous good ideas hold back your future good ideas.
