Hey guys, real quick...

We're out here at Tall Timbers Retreat Center in Woodsworth, Louisiana for the first every LateNite retreat! If you're not here, shame on ya self!

I'm having phone/computer connectivity issues so I have no pictures yet, but I'll work on that tomorrow hopefully...

Anyway, we had some slamming worship tonight already, and I'm sure there is much more to come. The honorable Reverend <a href="http://www.mikehaman.com">Michael Haman</a> is teaching us all right now and bringing the fire! Speaking of... I'm gonna go finish listening to the message! Hope you're all having a great weekend, I know mine is already off to an awesome start.
