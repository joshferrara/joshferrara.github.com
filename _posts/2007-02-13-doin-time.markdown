This weekend I was able to head out to Hunt Correctional Center. Brandon, Tab, Donald, Mark, Rob, Pastor Dino and myself were asked to go and minister to them at one of their chapel meetings. It was really mind blowing experience to say the least. Not the first time I've done prison stuff, but it's just so eye opening everytime you are in a situation like that. God just makes it so apparent how much we have to worship him for in every moment of our life.

I could talk for a while about this, but instead, check out <a href="http://brandon-4point5.blogspot.com/2007/02/last-night-i-had-incredible-opportunity.html">this slammin' post</a> by <a href="http://brandon-4point5.blogspot.com">Brandon</a>.

Thats all for nowwwww!
