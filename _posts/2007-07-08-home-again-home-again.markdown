Well I suppose we've all realized by now that the Submerge07 blog wasn't quite the buzz we had perhaps hoped. But, that is alright. It was mostly because of the lack of down time (good thing) during the week, and also because the little down time we had was spent at the beach or shopping.

Regardless, it was an awesome trip! And it was still well documented, we just never posted any pictures. But I plan to figure out an easy way to do that soon.

For the techies, I just switch my laptop over to <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> Linux running a Windows XP <a href="http://www.vmware.com">virtual machine</a>. It's much nicer, it works with my hardware much nicer. However, I'm still learning the in's and out's of it all, so I have had trouble doing mass uploads of photos to the web. (Any suggestions are welcome)

Also, quick little blog testimony...
I told you about the speeding tickets that <a href="http://eltonveals.blogspot.com">Elton</a> and myself received on our way to camp last week. Anyway, this week we spent a lot of time on the phone trying to find a way to have the tickets reduces in some way that wouldn't affect our insurance as much (or at all). However, after finding all of our options and deciding the first step was to pay the fine for the tickets, we called with our citation number and were surprised to find out that our tickets were not in the computer system at all! It has passed the deadline for the officer to submit the ticket so as far as we can tell, we don't have to worry about it anymore. Granted, I'm still going to keep checking, but you get the drift. Praise God, awesome stuff.

In other news, the L.A. Mission Team will be leaving a week from tomorrow (we leave on the 16th). I'm really excited about the crew that we have, and I know God has some awesome things planned for the people we come in contact with, and just as much in our group.

Things should be getting back to normal this week, and I will at least post from my phone during the L.A. trip.

As much as I love traveling, it's always good to be home.

Also, much love to Dan O. for the constant blog encouragement. Be sure to check out the new and improved <a href="http://www.danohlerking.com">DanOhlerking.com</a>!
