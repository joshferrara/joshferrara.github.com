The always interesting roller coaster of life has been quite ride the last few weeks, and unfortunately that ride has steered me somewhat clear of free computer time. Hence, no blog posts. Regularity again soon, at least that's what I plan. <br /><br />But for right now, I want to encourage you to take a look around these two blogs! Really, if you respect me at all, you'll go check them out. They are awesome guys that I'm honored to be able to call my friends, and they both have quite an interesting perspective to offer. So go take a look.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.bluekardia.com"><img src="http://www.bluekardia.com/v2/images/logo.png" /></a> <a href="http://www.mikehaman.com"><img src="http://www.mikehaman.com/wp-content/themes/red-is-nice-20/images/header.jpg" height="100" width="304" /></a><br /><br /><br /><p class="poweredbyperformancing">Powered by <a href="http://scribefire.com/">ScribeFire</a>.</p>
