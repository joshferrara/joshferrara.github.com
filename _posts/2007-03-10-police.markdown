Alright, this is going to be short and sweet. For any of you that know, this will make you smile :)

Anyway, this morning I got my tickets to The Police reunion tour. I'm pretty pumped. Not really a groupie or anything, but I'm certainly a fan, and its not every day that you get to see a classic band get back together, so it should be pretty nice.

Alright, that's all for now.
