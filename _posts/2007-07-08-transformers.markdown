I was going to mention this in my last post, but I have decided it deserves it's own post...

After watching Transformers: The Movie a total of 3 times this week, I decided to start a new category, possibly temporary, but I think it'll be fun.

The premise? If the concept of Transformers were real and there were AutoBots roaming among us, this (insert picture) would most likely be one.

Get it? Try to catch a transformer at their day job.

I'll try to keep up with this one, because it's obviously important stuff. Also, if you have a sighting feel free to post a link in a comment.

Here goes the first one...

I saw one of these today and couldn't help but think that it was just waiting to Transform...
