Chess Grandmaster Garry Kasparov won his first world-championship chess match in 1985 and went on to dominate the chess world for several decades. In [his book](http://www.amazon.com/How-Life-Imitates-Chess-Boardroom/dp/1596913886/) he shares this thought:

> A Grandmaster makes the best moves because they are based on what he wants the board to look like ten or twenty moves in the future.

I was challenged by this idea in [an essay](http://chasethegoose.com/files/10-steps-to-setting-life-goals.pdf) by Mark Batterson on setting life goals. As Batterson correctly points out, so many of us spend more time planning our next vacation than we do planning our lives. It's clearly no surprise that our lives don't turn out like we hoped when we haven't even put time aside to write down or think about what we might want our life to end up like in the first place.

If you can't tell, I'm guilty of this myself, and so I started out on a journey to document and make public the goals that I have for my life. But when I started down this road I was greeted by two interesting surprises:

1. I already had a surprising number of goals in my head, I just called them 'dreams' instead.
2. Since I began to write these dreams down, I've had an uncanning motivation to start reaching these goals.
    
To be clear, I wasn't making up goals from thin air; no, these were things I have had many conversations about, spent time dreaming about, and maybe even researched a bit over the years. But before I wrote them down, I wasn't accountable to them. **I couldn't fail at my goals because I hadn't officially made any.**
