      <h2>You are the best</h2>
      <p>You are charity: water &mdash; you're changing how our generation approaches the water crisis and charity on a macroscopic level. You inspire hope, challenge the standard, and make the world around you a better place.</p>

      <h2>You hire the best</h2>
      <p>An organization like charity: water can only function at the capacity it does if each member of the team is the best at what they do. When you hire a project manager, you'll need someone who believes in what you do but isn't scared to fight for an idea, or to tell you "no" if needed. To be truly valuable, extensive front-end (HTML / CSS / JS) and back-end (PHP / Ruby On Rails) development experience would definitely be needed.</p>

      <h2>Being the best is a challenge</h2>
      <p>You surely have your choice of many applicants for this position, and it's your job to sort through candidates that are "good" and find someone who is a "great" fit for the team.</p>

      <p>I've spent nearly a month preparing to apply for this job because more than I love the idea of working with people I admire and respect,  I'm passionate about the idea of working with people who are changing the world. </p>

      <p>I've followed and studied charity: water for years. Clearly there is knowledge I can learn from you, but I also believe there is great value that I can add back to the team as well.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="right">
      <h2>I'm well-rounded</h2>
      <p>I'm a developer, a designer, and a business guy. I bring products from the idea stage, through strategic planning, and then to life through design and development. I've managed teams, clients, vendors, and businesses, and I genuinely love working with people. I'm not your typical neckbeard software developer.</p>

      <p>Outside of work, I'm a novice runner, food lover (hence the running), and I've got a collection of books that seems to grow as fast as I can read.</p>

      <h2>I've done this before</h2>
      <p>I've built a mission trip fundraising platform (YouCanSend.me) from the ground up to help people around the world raise money. I've also joined an early stage startup and helped guide their political fundraising platform (Anedot) to new heights. The world of creative online fundraising isn't new to me, but I'm excited about the chance to learn even more about it.</p>

      <h2>I LOVE A challenge</h2>
      <p>I've worked as a freelancer, run a small business, led teams at a large company, and loved every moment of it all.</p>

      <p>Currently, I'm leading my own team of creatives at Hivemind Creative. I've got creative freedom, flexibility, control over the direction of the company, and no compelling reason to ever move on. But I want more. I want to learn more and get better at what I do. I want a challenge.</p>
