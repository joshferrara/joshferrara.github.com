With every new year comes new opportunities. This year, we are pretty excited about the paths in front of us. Time is money, so let’s get right to the good stuff.

## A New Focus
With each client we’ve taken on, we’ve seen our role shift more and more toward serving as creative consultants. We’ve helped build websites, design print pieces, and we’ll continue to offer those services as they are needed. Moving forward, we’ll also be focusing on being the entire creative solution for business and church teams that are looking to bring a fresh perspective to their creative process.

## A New Name
Sort of. Names are funny things. As we’ve moved through the years as a company, we’ve always been pleased with our name. This year, as we shift into a new season, we’ve decided to adjust our name to better reflect all that our company has become. Starting today, Hivemind Labs is now **Hivemind Creative.**

As we’ve begun to work with clients on a broader scale to develop all facets of their work, it only seemed right to have a name that better reflects what our days look like.

## A New Logo
Every new season deserves a new outfit, so with our newly polished name, we’ve decided to adjust our brand visuals as well. Starting today, you’ll start noticing our new look on lovely Hivemind projects around the web.

We asked our lovely designer, Gabrielle Ferrara, to craft a logo that put more emphasis on the core of our name (“Hivemind”), and we couldn’t be happier with what she’s put together.

## A New Site
This has been in the works for for quite some time, and we’re excited to let you take it for a spin. As our company has evolved, we’ve added and subtracted from our available services. Today, we’re launching a new site that will give you a better picture of what Hivemind can do for you and your team.

In addition to the new design, we’ll also be switching to a new address to match our shiny new name: [hivemind.co](http://hivemind.co).

## A New Partner
This is the one we’ve been dying to share with you! Starting today, [Lance LeBlanc](http://twitter.com/the_lance) is joining the Hivemind family as CEO & Lead Strategist. He brings with him a wealth of experience, working most recently at [Healing Place Church](http://healingplacechurch.org), where he served on the executive team as Creative Director and Executive Pastor.

Lance is joining the team at an exciting time, and we can’t wait to share some of the unique projects Lance will be working on in the coming weeks of this new venture.

## Full Steam Ahead
We truly couldn’t be more excited about all that the new year holds for Hivemind, and we’re excited to continue working with you and your teams.
