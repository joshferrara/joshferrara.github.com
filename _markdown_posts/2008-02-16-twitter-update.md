One day in and I'm already a fan. If you are even a slight techy, I encourage you to check out Twitter.

At first it doesn't really make sense, but don't try to put it in a box. Read the "About" section on their home page, it's got a little more info. Regardless, you need to check it out, and make sure when you do:   1.) You try it for at least a full day, and 2.) Don't be scared to add people you know to your friend list. That's what makes it interesting! If you check it out, come follow me, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/joshbob">twitter.com/joshbob</a>

Aside from that, today has been a long day, and a little soggy, but overall it was very nice. I love my friends, they make life interesting.
