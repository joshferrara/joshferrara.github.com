Hey guys, I just got this e-mail from my friend Brian Edwards at <a href="http://www.healingplacechurch.org">HPC</a>. Check it out and please take a moment to vote! It's for an awesome cause, and it's really easy to vote. Thanks!
<blockquote>Hey guys,

My wife needs your help to raise $50,000 through the Burger King's
"Campaign for Your Cause" grant. Kacy founded a non-profit called Career
Compass of LA in February of 2006. After teaching in the public schools
for nine years she and a fellow teacher decided to do something to give
the kids of our community, who have for the most part been given up on, a
fighting chance to do something more with their lives.

They are not asking for money (unless you fill lead to) all they are
asking for is your vote. You can vote everyday until June 14th. Here is a
link to their website. If you wish they can send you daily vote
reminders.

Thanks so much for your time. Please vote. Kacy and Julie are really
making a difference in the kids lives. With your help they can continue to
help make a difference in our community.

Your awesome!
Brian Edwards</blockquote>
