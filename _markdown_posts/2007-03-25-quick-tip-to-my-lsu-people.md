<span style="font-size:100%;"><span><span style="font-size:85%;">That will be your best friend as you begin your scheduling for the fall! You put in the classes you want to take and it gives you all the possible schedules. You can tell it you want a certain day off, or lunchtime free every day, or any other little things like that. Check it out!

Also, please continue to pray for <a href="http://joshferrara.blogspot.com/2007/03/prayer-request.html">Sam Seidel</a> and his family. They are needing a miracle right now and we know our God is big enough. Pray for them throughout your day if you think about them please.

Thanks guys.</span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">
