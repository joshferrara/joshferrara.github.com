So <a href="http://jpbrumfield.com">JP</a>, <a href="http://unclestevesplace.blogspot.com">Steve Ware</a> and myself are driving around today picking up items that people have donated for our <a href="http://hpcitaly.blogspot.com/">Italy team</a> to sell in a yard sale tomorrow morning to raise money for our trip.

Anyway this is the first of our valuable finds. Amazing, right. More to come...
