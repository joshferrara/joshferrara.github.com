So, for all of you that I forgot to tell, or didn't tell very intentionally, I am actually camping for the next few days somewhere on the Texas/Louisiana border. Granted, we're in cabins, with electricity, running water and heat. And of course, blogging capabilities! Point is, I'm in the woods, attempting to somewhat relax and "rough it". Hope you all are having a Happy Thanksgiving!
