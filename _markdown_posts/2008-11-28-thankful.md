This Thanksgiving I've got more than usual to be thankful for. Thursday afternoon I was in a wreck just before we left for a family camping trip.

To make a long story short, I was trying to avoid someone that was drifting into my lane (too much turkey will do that), and I didn't see a truck that was turning in front of me (due to lack of tail-lights or turn-signals).

All I remember is the impact, and then my car being smokey (airbag debris) as it felt like I was riding the teacup ride at Disney. My car spun a full 180, and the truck that I hit did about the same, as well as flipping on it's side.

It's only by the grace and favor of God that everyone walked away from the accident. There were 7 passengers in the other vehicle, most small children without seatbelts, in a truck that seats maybe 5. They were able to climb out the back window of the cab with only minor cuts.

My car (God rest her soul) didn't fare very well. The hood was bent up, broke the windshield and was only stopped from hitting my face by the safety glass film. After a little work to get the door open I was able to get out with only some cuts and bruises to show for it, and able to help the other family out of their vehicle.

I would normally never blog about this in this sort of detail except I sat in a message this weekend that talked about divine interruptions, and I can't help but look at this as such. The officer that filed the report couldn't understand how my car withstood that kind of impact well enough to keep me safe. There is no replacement for functional seatbelts and airbags, but I can't deny the clear second chance, His hand on my life.

So, wear your seatbelts please, they actually work. But make sure you look for the interruptions placed in your life, I have to think they are more than just a little inconvenient.
