So its been a while since I updated the picture section (or the blog in general). Anyway, I just uploaded about 100 photos, all from the camera phone since around January. Not really in any particular order, just take them for what they're worth!

That being said, the main thing that has kept me from keeping up with the blog is my new fascination with <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>. I really don't know how else to explain it other than telling you to watch <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=ddO9idmax0o">this video</a>. Basically, it's life between (or instead of) blog posts.

So, if you're interested, check me out @ <a href="http://www.twitter.com/joshbob/">twitter.com/joshbob.</a>

That's all for now. This summer is going to be good for the blog I think, got a little traveling planned and enough free time to change up a few things around here hopefully.

Blah blah blah, check out the <a href="http://www.josh-bob.com/photoalbum">photo section</a>.
