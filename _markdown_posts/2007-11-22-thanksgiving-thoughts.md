Doesn't really have much to do with the holiday, I was just curious...
When you put your shoes on, are you a Sock-Sock-Shoe-Shoe kind of person? Or are you of the Sock-Shoe-Sock-Shoe variety?
I hope you all have an amazing Thanksgiving! Show your families and loved ones how much you care, you never know when someone needs to hear it!
