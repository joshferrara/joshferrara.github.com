Hey guys,

I'm asking for your prayers right now on behalf of a good friend of mine, Greg Smith, and his daughter. She is 5 months old and has been diagnosed with Dilated Cardiomyopathy. Basically, the left ventricle, which is responsible for pumping oxygenated blood through the heart, is hardly pumping at all.

We know that our God is the great physician, and we know that His hand is on this family. Please, please pray for them any time they come across your mind, and pass this on to anyone that will pray for them also.

For updates, pictures, or just to let Greg, Lori, and Hannah know that you're praying for them, check out <a href="http://www.prayforhannah.org">www.PrayForHannah.org</a>

Thanks so much.
