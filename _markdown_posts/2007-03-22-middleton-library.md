I've had a few people ask why I don't post many pictures from school, and well, I honestly don't know why they asked. First of all, the majority of my pictures are, in fact, on campus. Secondly, I do not find joy in school. Accomplishment, maybe. Getting closer each day to graduating, yes. But there is no joy in everyday school, as you can see in this picture.

Also, Griffis... I had a dream last night and you and I were running from a crazed taco moster, and he was screaming "That's alot of taco!" Weird, right?

Anyway. Switchfoot and Copeland tonight. Many pictures and much video will follow.
