With the cold weather comes the blog snow. And with that, the extreme adoration of<a href="http://www.jpbrumfield.com"> JP Brumfield</a> (aka <a href="http://www.twitter.com/bigred1213">BigRed1213</a>).

Have fun with the new features, check them out in the sidebar.

Also, don't forget to follow me on twitter, much more action there than here these days - <a href="http://www.twitter.com/joshbob">Twitter.com/JoshBob</a>

Alright, procrastination done. Back to finals week.
