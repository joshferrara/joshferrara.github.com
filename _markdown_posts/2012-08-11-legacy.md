Today would be the 24th birthday of a great friend of mine, <a href="http://www.jordanslegacy.com/" target="_blank">Jordan Gautreau</a>. If you didn't have the pleasure of knowing him, I assure you there haven't been many men like Jordan.

It's easy to talk about the ripple you'd hope to leave after you're gone. It is, perhaps, easier still to declare how you will carry on the memory of a passing loved one.

However, I firmly believe the hardest — and most impactful — thing you can do with your life is to leave a legacy that challenges others, whether they like it or not.

Well done, Jordan.
