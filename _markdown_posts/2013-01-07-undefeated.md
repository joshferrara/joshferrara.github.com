I’m tired of it. I’ve heard it for weeks, and it’s more absurd each and every time.

> “Notre Dame doesn’t deserve to be in the National Championship Game.”

> “Sure they’re undefeated, but look at their schedule. Who have they played?”

This is some of the most childish logic I’ve ever heard from people who pay bills. This is my first time on the other side of the SEC fence, so I realize this sounds like [bandwagon talk](https://joshferrara.com/2013/01/06/the-bandwagon/), but bear with me.

Notre Dame deserves their spot in this game just like you deserve your job by being better qualified than every single other employable person on the planet. You didn’t have to beat out every better-qualified job-seeker in the world, you only had to outshine the other candidates. Notre Dame didn’t have to be better than all of the SEC. They needed to be better than the teams on their schedule. That is the system that’s in place.
