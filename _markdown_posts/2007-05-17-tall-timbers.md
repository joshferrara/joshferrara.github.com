Alright, so I decided to write a post about the first ever, <a href="http://store.healingplacechurch.org/ministries/latenite/07/">Late Nite</a> Retreat called <a href="http://store.healingplacechurch.org/ministries/latenite/07/?page_id=114">Fusion</a>! and I decided that I should find a few good websites so I could link to them like any good blogger would.

As I began googling, I came across this site. Let me reassure you, this is not the retreat center we will be hanging out at, but the site is probably much funnier than the real one :] So check out this site. I think I will deem this one my "<a href="http://www.talltimbers.net/">worst website of the week</a>".

And finally, I just really just thought you should see this picture. <a href="http://joelle19938.blogspot.com/">Joelle</a> was just finishing putting together this wonderful purse when I decided to take it for a test drive. Turns out, it makes a much nicer hat. What would she do without me?
