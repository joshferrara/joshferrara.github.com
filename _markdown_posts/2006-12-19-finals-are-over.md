Alright, so I've made it thought my first full-time semester at LSU. More surprisingly, for me at least, is the fact that I made it through with a 4.0! And the hardest class I had, geography... I aced the final. Crazzzyyy.

Anyway, there isn't much more to say  at the moment, just wanted to post that bit of info :)

Cheers
