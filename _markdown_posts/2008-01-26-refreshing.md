I'm just laying down after the first session of the HPC Student Ministries leadership retreat, and my heart is truly full and overflowing tonight. I can't begin to describe the excitement I have about the people that I not only work alongside every day but also get the privileged of calling my friends.<br /><br />Brandon, Tabitha, Elton, Faith, Lawrence, Ben, Mark, Ashlyn, and Steve, you are the most incredible team I've ever gotten to work with. I couldn't pick a better group, you guys are like family.<br />Jason Laird, Mike Haman, Jason Ryder, Brian, Fazha, Brad, Rob, Sarah, David, I don't know where I'd be without people like this pouring into me and helping me grow.<br /><br />There are so many people that inspire and influence my life on a daily basis just by being around them. Friends like JP, Matt Laborde, Brandon B., Jamie, Dustin Alise, Andrew, Dustin Anderson, Jordan, and Adam - having you all as a part of my life makes this Christian walk, and even just everyday life so much easier and more enjoyable.<br /><br />I know there are so many more that I'm not thinking of right now, but it's late, so sweat me. I love you guys, I couldn't find a better group of people if i tried.
