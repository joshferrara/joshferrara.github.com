I was just doing a little studying and this song came around on the iPod Shuffle. If you've never heard it, feel free to take a listen. If you have heard it, at least look over the lyrics. This is the kind of passion I strive for everyday, and I'm blessed beyond belief to be able to work with dozens of people on a regular basis that are running the race with me. Striving to have hearts that hurt for the things that hurt His heart.

<blockquote><em>There are many prodigal sons
On our city streets they run
Searching for shelter
There are homes broken down
Peopleâ€™s hopes have fallen to the ground
From failures</em>

<em><strong>This is an emergency!</strong></em>

<em>There are tears from the saints
For the lost and unsaved
Weâ€™re crying for them come back home
Weâ€™re crying for them come back home
<strong>And all your children will stretch out their hands
And pick up the crippled man
Father, we will lead them home
Father, we will lead them home</strong></em>

<em>There are schools full of hatred
Even churches have forsaken
Love and mercy
May we see this generation
In itâ€™s state of desperation
For Your glory</em>

<em><strong>This is an emergency!</strong></em>

<em>Sinner, reach out your hands!
Children in Christ you stand!
Sinner, reach out your hands!
Children in Christ you stand!</em>

<em><strong>And all Your children will stretch out their hands
And pick up the crippled man
Father, we will lead them home
Father, we will lead them home</strong></em></blockquote>
