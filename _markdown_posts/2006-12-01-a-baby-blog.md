So, this is pretty much surfacing from the need to express what's in my head, meshed with desire to keep my thoughts organized, with a dash of of my personal despise for pen and paper journaling. Sounds tasty, eh?

This is most likely going to be a mix of me feeling philosophical and me alerting the world to things I feel are important, such as new developments at Quiznos, or my personal opinion on Cheetos.

I hope you enjoy your time here.

Cheers.
