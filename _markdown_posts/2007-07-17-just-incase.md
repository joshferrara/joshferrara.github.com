Alright, so we are in the DreamCenter, after our first night and travel. Everyone is safe and sound, somewhat rested and ready to take on L.A. for Jesus.

Please remember to keep us in your prayers, we're quickly learning the amount of hurt and need in this city... Pray that God uses us to meet these needs in the best way possible. More updates coming, probably tonight when I have time!
