Ahh, you simply must experience the joy and relief of finishing a Spring semester to fully understand this amazing feeling. The grades weren't as hot as I'd like, but I'll live with a few B's.

I learned a lot this semester about study habits and college in general. It's crazy, but I'll be very ready to hit it again full force in the Fall!

But, before that!... This summer is going to be awesome! Heading to Los Angeles with the <a href="http://refuge.healingplacechurch.org/">Refuge</a> mission trip team, hitting up <a href="http://store.healingplacechurch.org/ministries/latenite/07/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/fusionweb.jpg">Fusion</a>, the first ever <a href="http://store.healingplacechurch.org/ministries/latenite/07/">LateNite</a> Retreat, annnd of course, <a href="http://submerge.healingplacechurch.org/">Submerge</a> Summer Camp, for the j-high and highschool sessions! And then even next semester a few weeks into school I'll be heading to Italy for an amazing opportunity to do some missions work with the <a href="http://store.healingplacechurch.org/ministries/latenite/07/">LateNite</a> team.

It's going to be an awesome summer, and an awesome remainder of this year!

Good luck to everyone on your remaining finals, and I hope everyone did awesome!
