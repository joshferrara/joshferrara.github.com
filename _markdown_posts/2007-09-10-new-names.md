Ok, I have more of a real post in the works, but before that, check out the blogroll, alright? I've just added my parents (<a href="http://dannyferrara.wordpress.com">Danny</a> and <a href="http://darnelle.wordpress.com">Darnelle</a>), <a href="http://kristindcheramie.blogspot.com/">Kristin Cheramie</a>, <a href="http://tricehead.blogspot.com">Trice Head</a>, <a href="http://tbarry.wordpress.com/">T-barry</a>... I think that is all. Anyway, give them some love! They all have really cool perspectives. And my parents might share stories about me ;)
