Sooo, I started my day pretty early. And I was walking through the quad and I saw this...

For a split second I was totally impressed with <a href="http://toriohlerking.blogspot.com">Tori</a>'s self-marketing. I know, I'm an idiot, but I forgot it was a national thing :]

Anyway, after class I went to the library...

While I was in the library I checked on some grades and one of my biggest projects was posted and I got a 100 on it! So I decided to celebrate. So I headed to Mr. Ghatti's with Caleb Persick and Caleb Crawford (from the band NoShoes)...

After lunch, I finished my last class and started on my way home, but not before stopping at Benny's to get a car wash... I really enjoy Benny's, don't tell anyone...

Then I finally started on my way home. But of course, I needed gas...

It was way too expensive.

The end.

Wasn't that exciting? Almost like you were with me all day, right?

Ok, I just had some pictures I wanted to show off.  And here are the rest :]

These are some of the coolest people around.  Ch-ch-ch-check it out:
