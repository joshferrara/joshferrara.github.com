I would like to take this time to apologize to my readers for the past week of inactivity in blogging, but more importantly, for the preceding week of <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=blogorrhea">blogorrhea</a>.

You see, during that time period, blogging was my way of remaining sane amidst the swirling and crazy world of studying for finals at <a href="http://www.lsu.edu">LSU</a>.

Alas, this is no excuse.

The same goes for this current week and the lack of posts that have encompassed it. There are no excuses, simply my own lack of energy, again, as a result of the terrible mess that we call finals.

But that is all over now. Today, we turn over a new leaf. This will most definitely be a blogging Summer, and I will strive to keep the highest quality in my posting, for you, the readers.

Also, I will be introducing a few new categories to my blog. Some will be fun and recreational, others will be regular pieces aimed at a general goal. More explanations will follow.

I would like to leave you with this picture. I found this guy at Tabitha's house. For those of you that don't know, Tabitha is one of the few at <a href="http://www.healingplacechurch.org">HPC</a> that share my wonderful Italian heritage.

I hope this brightens your day.
